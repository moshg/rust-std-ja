The logic is totally correct, except there's a subtle problem with our code: it's not exception-safe! set_len , offset , and write are all fine; clone is the panic bomb we over-looked. Clone is completely out of our control, and is totally free to panic. If it does, our function will exit early with the length of the Vec set too large. If the Vec is looked at or dropped, uninitialized memory will be read! The fix in this case is fairly simple. If we want to guarantee that the values we did clone are dropped, we can set the len every loop iteration. If we just want to guarantee that uninitialized memory can't be observed, we can set the len after the loop."},"unwinding.html#unwinding":{"body":"Rust has a tiered error-handling scheme: If something might reasonably be absent, Option is used. If something goes wrong and can reasonably be handled, Result is used. If something goes wrong and cannot reasonably be handled, the thread panics. If something catastrophic happens, the program aborts. Option and Result are overwhelmingly preferred in most situations, especially since they can be promoted into a panic or abort at the API user's discretion. Panics cause the thread to halt normal execution and unwind its stack, calling destructors as if every function instantly returned. As of 1.0, Rust is of two minds when it comes to panics. In the long-long-ago, Rust was much more like Erlang. Like Erlang, Rust had lightweight tasks, and tasks were intended to kill themselves with a panic when they reached an untenable state. Unlike an exception in Java or C++, a panic could not be caught at any time. Panics could only be caught by the owner of the task, at which point they had to be handled or that task would itself panic. Unwinding was important to this story because if a task's destructors weren't called, it would cause memory and other system resources to leak. Since tasks were expected to die during normal execution, this would make Rust very poor for long-running systems! As the Rust we know today came to be, this style of programming grew out of fashion in the push for less-and-less abstraction. Light-weight tasks were killed in the name of heavy-weight OS threads. Still, on stable Rust as of 1.0 panics can only be caught by the parent thread. This means catching a panic requires spinning up an entire OS thread! This unfortunately stands in conflict to Rust's philosophy of zero-cost abstractions. There is an unstable API called catch_panic that enables catching a panic without spawning a thread. Still, we would encourage you to only do this sparingly. In particular, Rust's current unwinding implementation is heavily optimized for the \"doesn't unwind\" case. If a program doesn't unwind, there should be no runtime cost for the program being ready to unwind. As a consequence, actually unwinding will be more expensive than in e.g. Java. Don't build your programs to unwind under normal circumstances. Ideally, you should only panic for programming errors or extreme problems. Rust's unwinding strategy is not specified to be fundamentally compatible with any other language's unwinding. As such, unwinding into Rust from another language, or unwinding into another language from Rust is Undefined Behavior. You must absolutely catch any panics at the FFI boundary! What you do at that point is up to you, but something must be done. If you fail to do this, at best, your application will crash and burn. At worst, your application won't crash and burn, and will proceed with completely clobbered state.","breadcrumbs":"Unwinding","id":"unwinding.html#unwinding","title":"Unwinding"},"what-unsafe-does.html#what-unsafe-rust-can-do":{"breadcrumbs":"Meet Safe and Unsafe » What Unsafe Rust Can Do","body":"The only things that are different in Unsafe Rust are that you can: Dereference raw pointers Call unsafe functions (including C functions, compiler intrinsics, and the raw allocator) Implement unsafe traits Mutate statics That's it. The reason these operations are relegated to Unsafe is that misusing any of these things will cause the ever dreaded Undefined Behavior. Invoking Undefined Behavior gives the compiler full rights to do arbitrarily bad things to your program. You definitely should not invoke Undefined Behavior. Unlike C, Undefined Behavior is pretty limited in scope in Rust. All the core language cares about is preventing the following things: Dereferencing null, dangling, or unaligned pointers Reading uninitialized memory Breaking the pointer aliasing rules Producing invalid primitive values: dangling/null references a bool that isn't 0 or 1 an undefined enum discriminant a char outside the ranges [0x0, 0xD7FF] and [0xE000, 0x10FFFF] A non-utf8 str Unwinding into another language Causing a data race That's it. That's all the causes of Undefined Behavior baked into Rust. Of course, unsafe functions and traits are free to declare arbitrary other constraints that a program must maintain to avoid Undefined Behavior. For instance, the allocator APIs declare that deallocating unallocated memory is Undefined Behavior. However, violations of these constraints generally will just transitively lead to one of the above problems. Some additional constraints may also derive from compiler intrinsics that make special assumptions about how code can be optimized. For instance, Vec and Box make use of intrinsics that require their pointers to be non-null at all times. Rust is otherwise quite permissive with respect to other dubious operations. Rust considers it \"safe\" to: Deadlock Have a race condition Leak memory Fail to call destructors Overflow integers Abort the program Delete the production database However any program that actually manages to do such a thing is probably incorrect. Rust provides lots of tools to make these things rare, but these problems are considered impractical to categorically prevent.","id":"what-unsafe-does.html#what-unsafe-rust-can-do","title":"What Unsafe Rust Can Do"},"destructors.html#destructors":{"breadcrumbs":"Ownership Based Resource Management » Destructors","body":"What the language does provide is full-blown automatic destructors through the Drop trait, which provides the following method: fn drop(&mut self); This method gives the type time to somehow finish what it was doing. After drop is run, Rust will recursively try to drop all of the fields of self . This is a convenience feature so that you don't have to write \"destructor boilerplate\" to drop children. If a struct has no special logic for being dropped other than dropping its children, then it means Drop doesn't need to be implemented at all! There is no stable way to prevent this behavior in Rust 1.0. Note that taking &mut self means that even if you could suppress recursive Drop, Rust will prevent you from e.g. moving fields out of self. For most types, this is totally fine. For instance, a custom implementation of Box might write Drop like this: #![feature(ptr_internals, allocator_api, unique)] use std::alloc::{Alloc, Global, GlobalAlloc, Layout};\nuse std::mem;\nuse std::ptr::{drop_in_place, NonNull, Unique}; struct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> } impl<T> Drop for Box<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { unsafe { drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr()); let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into(); Global.dealloc(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>()) } }\n}\n# fn main() {} and this works fine because when Rust goes to drop the ptr field it just sees a Unique that has no actual Drop implementation. Similarly nothing can use-after-free the ptr because when drop exits, it becomes inaccessible. However this wouldn't work: #![feature(allocator_api, ptr_internals, unique)] use std::alloc::{Alloc, Global, GlobalAlloc, Layout};\nuse std::ptr::{drop_in_place, Unique, NonNull};\nuse std::mem; struct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> } impl<T> Drop for Box<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { unsafe { drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr()); let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into(); Global.dealloc(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>()); } }\n} struct SuperBox<T> { my_box: Box<T> } impl<T> Drop for SuperBox<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { unsafe { // Hyper-optimized: deallocate the box's contents for it // without `drop`ing the contents let c: NonNull<T> = self.my_box.ptr.into(); Global.dealloc(c.cast::<u8>(), Layout::new::<T>()); } }\n}\n# fn main() {} After we deallocate the box 's ptr in SuperBox's destructor, Rust will happily proceed to tell the box to Drop itself and everything will blow up with use-after-frees and double-frees. Note that the recursive drop behavior applies to all structs and enums regardless of whether they implement Drop. Therefore something like struct Boxy<T> { data1: Box<T>, data2: Box<T>, info: u32,\n} will have its data1 and data2's fields destructors whenever it \"would\" be dropped, even though it itself doesn't implement Drop. We say that such a type needs Drop , even though it is not itself Drop. Similarly, enum Link { Next(Box<Link>), None,\n} will have its inner Box field dropped if and only if an instance stores the Next variant. In general this works really nicely because you don't need to worry about adding/removing drops when you refactor your data layout. Still there's certainly many valid usecases for needing to do trickier things with destructors. The classic safe solution to overriding recursive drop and allowing moving out of Self during drop is to use an Option: #![feature(allocator_api, ptr_internals, unique)] use std::alloc::{Alloc, GlobalAlloc, Global, Layout};\nuse std::ptr::{drop_in_place, Unique, NonNull};\nuse std::mem; struct Box<T>{ ptr: Unique<T> } impl<T> Drop for Box<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { unsafe { drop_in_place(self.ptr.as_ptr()); let c: NonNull<T> = self.ptr.into(); Global.dealloc(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>()); } }\n} struct SuperBox<T> { my_box: Option<Box<T>> } impl<T> Drop for SuperBox<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { unsafe { // Hyper-optimized: deallocate the box's contents for it // without `drop`ing the contents. Need to set the `box` // field as `None` to prevent Rust from trying to Drop it. let my_box = self.my_box.take().unwrap(); let c: NonNull<T> = my_box.ptr.into(); Global.dealloc(c.cast(), Layout::new::<T>()); mem::forget(my_box); } }\n}\n# fn main() {} However this has fairly odd semantics: you're saying that a field that should always be Some may be None, just because that happens in the destructor. Of course this conversely makes a lot of sense: you can call arbitrary methods on self during the destructor, and this should prevent you from ever doing so after deinitializing the field. Not that it will prevent you from producing any other arbitrarily invalid state in there. On balance this is an ok choice. Certainly what you should reach for by default. However, in the future we expect there to be a first-class way to announce that a field shouldn't be automatically dropped.","title":"Destructors","id":"destructors.html#destructors"},"other-reprs.html#repru-repri":{"id":"other-reprs.html#repru-repri","title":"repr(u*), repr(i*)","breadcrumbs":"Data Layout » repr(u*), repr(i*)","body":"These specify the size to make a field-less enum.

First, the compiler will give us too strict variance. So a &Vec<&'static str> couldn't be used where an &Vec<&'a str> was expected. More importantly, it will give incorrect ownership information to the drop checker, as it will conservatively assume we don't own any values of type T . See the chapter on ownership and lifetimes for all the details on variance and drop check. As we saw in the ownership chapter, we should use Unique<T> in place of *mut T when we have a raw pointer to an allocation we own. Unique is unstable, so we'd like to not use it if possible, though. As a recap, Unique is a wrapper around a raw pointer that declares that: We are variant over T We may own a value of type T (for drop check) We are Send/Sync if T is Send/Sync Our pointer is never null (so Option<Vec<T>> is null-pointer-optimized) We can implement all of the above requirements except for the last one in stable Rust: use std::marker::PhantomData;\nuse std::ops::Deref;\nuse std::mem; struct Unique<T> { ptr: *const T, // *const for variance _marker: PhantomData<T>, // For the drop checker\n} // Deriving Send and Sync is safe because we are the Unique owners\n// of this data.

However some conversions require a cast. While coercions are pervasive and largely harmless, these \"true casts\" are rare and potentially dangerous. As such, casts must be explicitly invoked using the as keyword: expr as Type . True casts generally revolve around raw pointers and the primitive numeric types. Even though they're dangerous, these casts are infallible at runtime. If a cast triggers some subtle corner case no indication will be given that this occurred. The cast will simply succeed. That said, casts must be valid at the type level, or else they will be prevented statically. For instance, 7u8 as bool will not compile. That said, casts aren't unsafe because they generally can't violate memory safety on their own . For instance, converting an integer to a raw pointer can very easily lead to terrible things. However the act of creating the pointer itself is safe, because actually using a raw pointer is already marked as unsafe . Here's an exhaustive list of all the true casts. For brevity, we will use * to denote either a *const or *mut , and integer to denote any integral primitive: *T as *U where T, U: Sized *T as *U TODO: explain unsized situation *T as integer integer as *T number as number field-less enum as integer bool as integer char as integer u8 as char &[T; n] as *const T fn as *T where T: Sized fn as integer Note that lengths are not adjusted when casting raw slices - *const [u16] as *const [u8] creates a slice that only includes half of the original memory. Casting is not transitive, that is, even if e as U1 as U2 is a valid expression, e as U2 is not necessarily so. For numeric casts, there are quite a few cases to consider: casting between two integers of the same size (e.g. i32 -> u32) is a no-op casting from a larger integer to a smaller integer (e.g. u32 -> u8) will truncate casting from a smaller integer to a larger integer (e.g. u8 -> u32) will zero-extend if the source is unsigned sign-extend if the source is signed casting from a float to an integer will round the float towards zero NOTE: currently this will cause Undefined Behavior if the rounded value cannot be represented by the target integer type . This includes Inf and NaN. This is a bug and will be fixed. casting from an integer to float will produce the floating point representation of the integer, rounded if necessary (rounding to nearest, ties to even) casting from an f32 to an f64 is perfect and lossless casting from an f64 to an f32 will produce the closest possible value (rounding to nearest, ties to even)"},"vec-zsts.html#allocating-zero-sized-types":{"id":"vec-zsts.html#allocating-zero-sized-types","body":"So if the allocator API doesn't support zero-sized allocations, what on earth do we store as our allocation?

This actually extends to ptr::read and ptr::write : they won't actually look at the pointer at all. As such we never need to change the pointer. Note however that our previous reliance on running out of memory before overflow is no longer valid with zero-sized types. We must explicitly guard against capacity overflow for zero-sized types.

Consider this simple function: fn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) { if *input > 10 { *output = 1; } if *input > 5 { *output *= 2; }\n} We would like to be able to optimize it to the following function: fn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) { let cached_input = *input; // keep *input in a register if cached_input > 10 { *output = 2; // x > 10 implies x > 5, so double and exit immediately } else if cached_input > 5 { *output *= 2; }\n} In Rust, this optimization should be sound. For almost any other language, it wouldn't be (barring global analysis). This is because the optimization relies on knowing that aliasing doesn't occur, which most languages are fairly liberal with. Specifically, we need to worry about function arguments that make input and output overlap, such as compute(&x, &mut x) . With that input, we could get this execution: // input == output == 0xabad1dea // *input == *output == 20\nif *input > 10 { // true (*input == 20) *output = 1; // also overwrites *input, because they are the same\n}\nif *input > 5 { // false (*input == 1) *output *= 2;\n} // *input == *output == 1 Our optimized function would produce *output == 2 for this input, so the correctness of our optimization relies on this input being impossible. In Rust we know this input should be impossible because &mut isn't allowed to be aliased. So we can safely reject its possibility and perform this optimization. In most other languages, this input would be entirely possible, and must be considered. This is why alias analysis is important: it lets the compiler perform useful optimizations! Some examples: keeping values in registers by proving no pointers access the value's memory eliminating reads by proving some memory hasn't been written to since last we read it eliminating writes by proving some memory is never read before the next write to it moving or reordering reads and writes by proving they don't depend on each other These optimizations also tend to prove the soundness of bigger optimizations such as loop vectorization, constant propagation, and dead code elimination. In the previous example, we used the fact that &mut u32 can't be aliased to prove that writes to *output can't possibly affect *input . This let us cache *input in a register, eliminating a read. By caching this read, we knew that the the write in the > 10 branch couldn't affect whether we take the > 5 branch, allowing us to also eliminate a read-modify-write (doubling *output ) when *input > 10 . The key thing to remember about alias analysis is that writes are the primary hazard for optimizations. That is, the only thing that prevents us from moving a read to any other part of the program is the possibility of us re-ordering it with a write to the same location. For instance, we have no concern for aliasing in the following modified version of our function, because we've moved the only write to *output to the very end of our function. This allows us to freely reorder the reads of *input that occur before it: fn compute(input: &u32, output: &mut u32) { let mut temp = *output; if *input > 10 { temp = 1; } if *input > 5 { temp *= 2; } *output = temp;\n} We're still relying on alias analysis to assume that temp doesn't alias input , but the proof is much simpler: the value of a local variable can't be aliased by things that existed before it was declared. This is an assumption every language freely makes, and so this version of the function could be optimized the way we want in any language. This is why the definition of \"alias\" that Rust will use likely involves some notion of liveness and mutation: we don't actually care if aliasing occurs if there aren't any actual writes to memory happening. Of course, a full aliasing model for Rust must also take into consideration things like function calls (which may mutate things we don't see), raw pointers (which have no aliasing requirements on their own), and UnsafeCell (which lets the referent of an & be mutated).","id":"aliasing.html#why-aliasing-matters","breadcrumbs":"Ownership » Why Aliasing Matters"},"vec-zsts.html#handling-zero-sized-types":{"title":"Handling Zero-Sized Types","breadcrumbs":"Implementing Vec » Handling Zero-Sized Types","id":"vec-zsts.html#handling-zero-sized-types","body":"It's time.

Such a lifetime becomes as big as context demands.

However for most intents and purposes, such an unbounded lifetime can be regarded as 'static . Almost no reference is 'static , so this is probably wrong. transmute and transmute_copy are the two other primary offenders. One should endeavor to bound an unbounded lifetime as quickly as possible, especially across function boundaries. Given a function, any output lifetimes that don't derive from inputs are unbounded. For instance: fn get_str<'a>() -> &'a str; will produce an &str with an unbounded lifetime. The easiest way to avoid unbounded lifetimes is to use lifetime elision at the function boundary. If an output lifetime is elided, then it must be bounded by an input lifetime. Of course it might be bounded by the wrong lifetime, but this will usually just cause a compiler error, rather than allow memory safety to be trivially violated. Within a function, bounding lifetimes is more error-prone. The safest and easiest way to bound a lifetime is to return it from a function with a bound lifetime.

Safe Rust doesn't permit you to partially initialize an array. When you initialize an array, you can either set every value to the same thing with let x = [val; N] , or you can specify each member individually with let x = [val1, val2, val3] . Unfortunately this is pretty rigid, especially if you need to initialize your array in a more incremental or dynamic way. Unsafe Rust gives us a powerful tool to handle this problem: mem::uninitialized . This function pretends to return a value when really it does nothing at all. Using it, we can convince Rust that we have initialized a variable, allowing us to do trickier things with conditional and incremental initialization. Unfortunately, this opens us up to all kinds of problems. Assignment has a different meaning to Rust based on whether it believes that a variable is initialized or not. If it's believed uninitialized, then Rust will semantically just memcopy the bits over the uninitialized ones, and do nothing else. However if Rust believes a value to be initialized, it will try to Drop the old value! Since we've tricked Rust into believing that the value is initialized, we can no longer safely use normal assignment. This is also a problem if you're working with a raw system allocator, which returns a pointer to uninitialized memory. To handle this, we must use the ptr module. In particular, it provides three functions that allow us to assign bytes to a location in memory without dropping the old value: write , copy , and copy_nonoverlapping . ptr::write(ptr, val) takes a val and moves it into the address pointed to by ptr . ptr::copy(src, dest, count) copies the bits that count T's would occupy from src to dest. (this is equivalent to memmove -- note that the argument order is reversed!) ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(src, dest, count) does what copy does, but a little faster on the assumption that the two ranges of memory don't overlap. (this is equivalent to memcpy -- note that the argument order is reversed!) It should go without saying that these functions, if misused, will cause serious havoc or just straight up Undefined Behavior. The only things that these functions themselves require is that the locations you want to read and write are allocated. However the ways writing arbitrary bits to arbitrary locations of memory can break things are basically uncountable! Putting this all together, we get the following: use std::mem;\nuse std::ptr; // size of the array is hard-coded but easy to change.

Similarly you should be able to assign to fields of partially initialized structs directly if those fields don't contain any Drop types. However when working with uninitialized memory you need to be ever-vigilant for Rust trying to drop values you make like this before they're fully initialized. Every control path through that variable's scope must initialize the value before it ends, if it has a destructor. This includes code panicking .

Some types allow you to have multiple aliases of a location in memory while mutating it. Unless these types use synchronization to manage this access, they are absolutely not thread-safe. Rust captures this through the Send and Sync traits. A type is Send if it is safe to send it to another thread. A type is Sync if it is safe to share between threads ( &T is Send). Send and Sync are fundamental to Rust's concurrency story. As such, a substantial amount of special tooling exists to make them work right. First and foremost, they're unsafe traits . This means that they are unsafe to implement, and other unsafe code can assume that they are correctly implemented. Since they're marker traits (they have no associated items like methods), correctly implemented simply means that they have the intrinsic properties an implementor should have. Incorrectly implementing Send or Sync can cause Undefined Behavior. Send and Sync are also automatically derived traits. This means that, unlike every other trait, if a type is composed entirely of Send or Sync types, then it is Send or Sync. Almost all primitives are Send and Sync, and as a consequence pretty much all types you'll ever interact with are Send and Sync. Major exceptions include: raw pointers are neither Send nor Sync (because they have no safety guards). UnsafeCell isn't Sync (and therefore Cell and RefCell aren't). Rc isn't Send or Sync (because the refcount is shared and unsynchronized). Rc and UnsafeCell are very fundamentally not thread-safe: they enable unsynchronized shared mutable state. However raw pointers are, strictly speaking, marked as thread-unsafe as more of a lint . Doing anything useful with a raw pointer requires dereferencing it, which is already unsafe. In that sense, one could argue that it would be \"fine\" for them to be marked as thread safe. However it's important that they aren't thread-safe to prevent types that contain them from being automatically marked as thread-safe. These types have non-trivial untracked ownership, and it's unlikely that their author was necessarily thinking hard about thread safety. In the case of Rc , we have a nice example of a type that contains a *mut that is definitely not thread-safe. Types that aren't automatically derived can simply implement them if desired: struct MyBox(*mut u8); unsafe impl Send for MyBox {}\nunsafe impl Sync for MyBox {} In the incredibly rare case that a type is inappropriately automatically derived to be Send or Sync, then one can also unimplement Send and Sync: #![feature(optin_builtin_traits)] // I have some magic semantics for some synchronization primitive!\nstruct SpecialThreadToken(u8); impl !Send for SpecialThreadToken {}\nimpl !Sync for SpecialThreadToken {} Note that in and of itself it is impossible to incorrectly derive Send and Sync. Only types that are ascribed special meaning by other unsafe code can possible cause trouble by being incorrectly Send or Sync. Most uses of raw pointers should be encapsulated behind a sufficient abstraction that Send and Sync can be derived. For instance all of Rust's standard collections are Send and Sync (when they contain Send and Sync types) in spite of their pervasive use of raw pointers to manage allocations and complex ownership. Similarly, most iterators into these collections are Send and Sync because they largely behave like an & or &mut into the collection. TODO: better explain what can or can't be Send or Sync.

Interestingly, Rust doesn't require the variable to be mutable to perform a delayed initialization if every branch assigns exactly once. However the analysis does not take advantage of constant analysis or anything like that. So this compiles: fn main() { let x: i32; if true { x = 1; } else { x = 2; } println!(\"{}\", x);\n} but this doesn't: fn main() { let x: i32; if true { x = 1; } println!(\"{}\", x);\n} src/main.rs:6:17: 6:18 error: use of possibly uninitialized variable: `x`\nsrc/main.rs:6 println!(\"{}\", x); while this does: fn main() { let x: i32; if true { x = 1; println!(\"{}\", x); } // Don't care that there are branches where it's not initialized // since we don't use the value in those branches\n} Of course, while the analysis doesn't consider actual values, it does have a relatively sophisticated understanding of dependencies and control flow.

So if we can't allocate, but also can't put a null pointer in ptr , what do we do in Vec::new ? Well, we just put some other garbage in there! This is perfectly fine because we already have cap == 0 as our sentinel for no allocation. We don't even need to handle it specially in almost any code because we usually need to check if cap > len or len > 0 anyway. The recommended Rust value to put here is mem::align_of::<T>() . Unique provides a convenience for this: Unique::empty() . There are quite a few places where we'll want to use empty because there's no real allocation to talk about but null would make the compiler do bad things. So: #![feature(alloc, heap_api)] use std::mem; impl<T> Vec<T> { fn new() -> Self { assert!(mem::size_of::<T>() != 0, \"We're not ready to handle ZSTs\"); Vec { ptr: Unique::empty(), len: 0, cap: 0 } }\n} I slipped in that assert there because zero-sized types will require some special handling throughout our code, and I want to defer the issue for now. Without this assert, some of our early drafts will do some Very Bad Things. Next we need to figure out what to actually do when we do want space. For that, we'll need to use the rest of the heap APIs. These basically allow us to talk directly to Rust's allocator (jemalloc by default). We'll also need a way to handle out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. The standard library calls std::alloc::oom() , which in turn calls the the oom langitem. By default this just aborts the program by executing an illegal cpu instruction. The reason we abort and don't panic is because unwinding can cause allocations to happen, and that seems like a bad thing to do when your allocator just came back with \"hey I don't have any more memory\". Of course, this is a bit silly since most platforms don't actually run out of memory in a conventional way. Your operating system will probably kill the application by another means if you legitimately start using up all the memory. The most likely way we'll trigger OOM is by just asking for ludicrous quantities of memory at once (e.g. half the theoretical address space). As such it's probably fine to panic and nothing bad will happen. Still, we're trying to be like the standard library as much as possible, so we'll just kill the whole program. Okay, now we can write growing. Roughly, we want to have this logic: if cap == 0: allocate() cap = 1\nelse: reallocate() cap *= 2 But Rust's only supported allocator API is so low level that we'll need to do a fair bit of extra work. We also need to guard against some special conditions that can occur with really large allocations or empty allocations. In particular, ptr::offset will cause us a lot of trouble, because it has the semantics of LLVM's GEP inbounds instruction. If you're fortunate enough to not have dealt with this instruction, here's the basic story with GEP: alias analysis, alias analysis, alias analysis. It's super important to an optimizing compiler to be able to reason about data dependencies and aliasing. As a simple example, consider the following fragment of code: # let x = &mut 0;\n# let y = &mut 0;\n*x *= 7;\n*y *= 3; If the compiler can prove that x and y point to different locations in memory, the two operations can in theory be executed in parallel (by e.g. loading them into different registers and working on them independently). However the compiler can't do this in general because if x and y point to the same location in memory, the operations need to be done to the same value, and they can't just be merged afterwards. When you use GEP inbounds, you are specifically telling LLVM that the offsets you're about to do are within the bounds of a single \"allocated\" entity. The ultimate payoff being that LLVM can assume that if two pointers are known to point to two disjoint objects, all the offsets of those pointers are also known to not alias (because you won't just end up in some random place in memory). LLVM is heavily optimized to work with GEP offsets, and inbounds offsets are the best of all, so it's important that we use them as much as possible. So that's what GEP's about, how can it cause us trouble? The first problem is that we index into arrays with unsigned integers, but GEP (and as a consequence ptr::offset ) takes a signed integer. This means that half of the seemingly valid indices into an array will overflow GEP and actually go in the wrong direction! As such we must limit all allocations to isize::MAX elements. This actually means we only need to worry about byte-sized objects, because e.g. > isize::MAX u16 s will truly exhaust all of the system's memory. However in order to avoid subtle corner cases where someone reinterprets some array of < isize::MAX objects as bytes, std limits all allocations to isize::MAX bytes. On all 64-bit targets that Rust currently supports we're artificially limited to significantly less than all 64 bits of the address space (modern x64 platforms only expose 48-bit addressing), so we can rely on just running out of memory first. However on 32-bit targets, particularly those with extensions to use more of the address space (PAE x86 or x32), it's theoretically possible to successfully allocate more than isize::MAX bytes of memory. However since this is a tutorial, we're not going to be particularly optimal here, and just unconditionally check, rather than use clever platform-specific cfg s. The other corner-case we need to worry about is empty allocations. There will be two kinds of empty allocations we need to worry about: cap = 0 for all T, and cap > 0 for zero-sized types. These cases are tricky because they come down to what LLVM means by \"allocated\". LLVM's notion of an allocation is significantly more abstract than how we usually use it. Because LLVM needs to work with different languages' semantics and custom allocators, it can't really intimately understand allocation. Instead, the main idea behind allocation is \"doesn't overlap with other stuff\". That is, heap allocations, stack allocations, and globals don't randomly overlap. Yep, it's about alias analysis. As such, Rust can technically play a bit fast and loose with the notion of an allocation as long as it's consistent . Getting back to the empty allocation case, there are a couple of places where we want to offset by 0 as a consequence of generic code. The question is then: is it consistent to do so? For zero-sized types, we have concluded that it is indeed consistent to do a GEP inbounds offset by an arbitrary number of elements. This is a runtime no-op because every element takes up no space, and it's fine to pretend that there's infinite zero-sized types allocated at 0x01 . No allocator will ever allocate that address, because they won't allocate 0x00 and they generally allocate to some minimal alignment higher than a byte. Also generally the whole first page of memory is protected from being allocated anyway (a whole 4k, on many platforms). However what about for positive-sized types? That one's a bit trickier. In principle, you can argue that offsetting by 0 gives LLVM no information: either there's an element before the address or after it, but it can't know which. However we've chosen to conservatively assume that it may do bad things. As such we will guard against this case explicitly. Phew Ok with all the nonsense out of the way, let's actually allocate some memory: use std::alloc::oom; fn grow(&mut self) { // this is all pretty delicate, so let's say it's all unsafe unsafe { // current API requires us to specify size and alignment manually. let align = mem::align_of::<T>(); let elem_size = mem::size_of::<T>(); let (new_cap, ptr) = if self.cap == 0 { let ptr = heap::allocate(elem_size, align); (1, ptr) } else { // as an invariant, we can assume that `self.cap < isize::MAX`, // so this doesn't need to be checked. let new_cap = self.cap * 2; // Similarly this can't overflow due to previously allocating this let old_num_bytes = self.cap * elem_size; // check that the new allocation doesn't exceed `isize::MAX` at all // regardless of the actual size of the capacity. This combines the // `new_cap <= isize::MAX` and `new_num_bytes <= usize::MAX` checks // we need to make. We lose the ability to allocate e.g. 2/3rds of // the address space with a single Vec of i16's on 32-bit though. // Alas, poor Yorick -- I knew him, Horatio. assert!(old_num_bytes <= (::std::isize::MAX as usize) / 2, \"capacity overflow\"); let new_num_bytes = old_num_bytes * 2; let ptr = heap::reallocate(self.ptr.as_ptr() as *mut _, old_num_bytes, new_num_bytes, align); (new_cap, ptr) }; // If allocate or reallocate fail, we'll get `null` back if ptr.is_null() { oom(); } self.ptr = Unique::new(ptr as *mut _); self.cap = new_cap; }\n} Nothing particularly tricky here.

We would rather have the following: bubble_up(heap, index): let elem = heap[index] while index != 0 && elem < heap[parent(index)]: heap[index] = heap[parent(index)] index = parent(index) heap[index] = elem This code ensures that each element is copied as little as possible (it is in fact necessary that elem be copied twice in general). However it now exposes some exception safety trouble! At all times, there exists two copies of one value. If we panic in this function something will be double-dropped. Unfortunately, we also don't have full control of the code: that comparison is user-defined! Unlike Vec, the fix isn't as easy here. One option is to break the user-defined code and the unsafe code into two separate phases: bubble_up(heap, index): let end_index = index; while end_index != 0 && heap[end_index] < heap[parent(end_index)]: end_index = parent(end_index) let elem = heap[index] while index != end_index: heap[index] = heap[parent(index)] index = parent(index) heap[index] = elem If the user-defined code blows up, that's no problem anymore, because we haven't actually touched the state of the heap yet. Once we do start messing with the heap, we're working with only data and functions that we trust, so there's no concern of panics. Perhaps you're not happy with this design. Surely it's cheating! And we have to do the complex heap traversal twice ! Alright, let's bite the bullet. Let's intermix untrusted and unsafe code for reals .

Anyone who observes the heap will see a potentially inconsistent heap, but at least it won't cause any double-drops! If the algorithm terminates normally, then this operation happens to coincide precisely with the how we finish up regardless. Sadly, Rust has no such construct, so we're going to need to roll our own! The way to do this is to store the algorithm's state in a separate struct with a destructor for the \"finally\" logic.

However as with many curious layout choices in Rust, their potential is realized in a generic context: Rust largely understands that any operation that produces or stores a ZST can be reduced to a no-op. First off, storing it doesn't even make sense -- it doesn't occupy any space. Also there's only one value of that type, so anything that loads it can just produce it from the aether -- which is also a no-op since it doesn't occupy any space. One of the most extreme example's of this is Sets and Maps. Given a Map<Key, Value> , it is common to implement a Set<Key> as just a thin wrapper around Map<Key, UselessJunk> . In many languages, this would necessitate allocating space for UselessJunk and doing work to store and load UselessJunk only to discard it. Proving this unnecessary would be a difficult analysis for the compiler. However in Rust, we can just say that Set<Key> = Map<Key, ()> . Now Rust statically knows that every load and store is useless, and no allocation has any size.

However there's two interesting iterators that Vec provides that slices can't: into_iter and drain . IntoIter consumes the Vec by-value, and can consequently yield its elements by-value. In order to enable this, IntoIter needs to take control of Vec's allocation. IntoIter needs to be DoubleEnded as well, to enable reading from both ends. Reading from the back could just be implemented as calling pop , but reading from the front is harder. We could call remove(0) but that would be insanely expensive. Instead we're going to just use ptr::read to copy values out of either end of the Vec without mutating the buffer at all. To do this we're going to use a very common C idiom for array iteration. We'll make two pointers; one that points to the start of the array, and one that points to one-element past the end. When we want an element from one end, we'll read out the value pointed to at that end and move the pointer over by one. When the two pointers are equal, we know we're done. Note that the order of read and offset are reversed for next and next_back For next_back the pointer is always after the element it wants to read next, while for next the pointer is always at the element it wants to read next. To see why this is, consider the case where every element but one has been yielded. The array looks like this: S E\n[X, X, X, O, X, X, X] If E pointed directly at the element it wanted to yield next, it would be indistinguishable from the case where there are no more elements to yield. Although we don't actually care about it during iteration, we also need to hold onto the Vec's allocation information in order to free it once IntoIter is dropped. So we're going to use the following struct: struct IntoIter<T> { buf: Unique<T>, cap: usize, start: *const T, end: *const T,\n} And this is what we end up with for initialization: impl<T> Vec<T> { fn into_iter(self) -> IntoIter<T> { // Can't destructure Vec since it's Drop let ptr = self.ptr; let cap = self.cap; let len = self.len; // Make sure not to drop Vec since that will free the buffer mem::forget(self); unsafe { IntoIter { buf: ptr, cap: cap, start: *ptr, end: if cap == 0 { // can't offset off this pointer, it's not allocated! *ptr } else { ptr.offset(len as isize) } } } }\n} Here's iterating forward: impl<T> Iterator for IntoIter<T> { type Item = T; fn next(&mut self) -> Option<T> { if self.start == self.end { None } else { unsafe { let result = ptr::read(self.start); self.start = self.start.offset(1); Some(result) } } } fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>) { let len = (self.end as usize - self.start as usize) / mem::size_of::<T>(); (len, Some(len)) }\n} And here's iterating backwards. impl<T> DoubleEndedIterator for IntoIter<T> { fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<T> { if self.start == self.end { None } else { unsafe { self.end = self.end.offset(-1); Some(ptr::read(self.end)) } } }\n} Because IntoIter takes ownership of its allocation, it needs to implement Drop to free it. However it also wants to implement Drop to drop any elements it contains that weren't yielded. impl<T> Drop for IntoIter<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { if self.cap != 0 { // drop any remaining elements for _ in &mut *self {} let align = mem::align_of::<T>(); let elem_size = mem::size_of::<T>(); let num_bytes = elem_size * self.cap; unsafe { heap::deallocate(self.buf.as_ptr() as *mut _, num_bytes, align); } } }\n}","id":"vec-into-iter.html#intoiter","breadcrumbs":"Implementing Vec » IntoIter"},"references.html#references":{"title":"References","id":"references.html#references","body":"There are two kinds of reference: Shared reference: & Mutable reference: &mut Which obey the following rules: A reference cannot outlive its referent A mutable reference cannot be aliased That's it.

So fn foo(s: &str) -> (&str, &str) has elided one lifetime in input position and two lifetimes in output position.

Every other way you make an instance of a type is just calling a totally vanilla function that does some stuff and eventually bottoms out to The One True Constructor. Unlike C++, Rust does not come with a slew of built-in kinds of constructor. There are no Copy, Default, Assignment, Move, or whatever constructors. The reasons for this are varied, but it largely boils down to Rust's philosophy of being explicit . Move constructors are meaningless in Rust because we don't enable types to \"care\" about their location in memory. Every type must be ready for it to be blindly memcopied to somewhere else in memory. This means pure on-the-stack-but- still-movable intrusive linked lists are simply not happening in Rust (safely). Assignment and copy constructors similarly don't exist because move semantics are the only semantics in Rust. At most x = y just moves the bits of y into the x variable. Rust does provide two facilities for providing C++'s copy- oriented semantics: Copy and Clone . Clone is our moral equivalent of a copy constructor, but it's never implicitly invoked. You have to explicitly call clone on an element you want to be cloned. Copy is a special case of Clone where the implementation is just \"copy the bits\". Copy types are implicitly cloned whenever they're moved, but because of the definition of Copy this just means not treating the old copy as uninitialized -- a no-op. While Rust provides a Default trait for specifying the moral equivalent of a default constructor, it's incredibly rare for this trait to be used. This is because variables aren't implicitly initialized . Default is basically only useful for generic programming. In concrete contexts, a type will provide a static new method for any kind of \"default\" constructor. This has no relation to new in other languages and has no special meaning.

Variance is a property that type constructors have with respect to their arguments. A type constructor in Rust is a generic type with unbound arguments. For instance Vec is a type constructor that takes a T and returns a Vec<T> . & and &mut are type constructors that take two inputs: a lifetime, and a type to point to. A type constructor's variance is how the subtyping of its inputs affects the subtyping of its outputs. There are three kinds of variance in Rust: F is covariant over T if T being a subtype of U implies F<T> is a subtype of F<U> (subtyping \"passes through\") F is contravariant over T if T being a subtype of U implies F<U> is a subtype of F<U> (subtyping is \"inverted\") F is invariant over T otherwise (no subtyping relation can be derived) It should be noted that covariance is far more common and important than contravariance in Rust. The existence of contravariance in Rust can mostly be ignored. Some important variances (which we will explain in detail below): &'a T is covariant over 'a and T (as is *const T by metaphor) &'a mut T is covariant over 'a but invariant over T fn(T) -> U is contra variant over T , but covariant over U Box , Vec , and all other collections are covariant over the types of their contents UnsafeCell<T> , Cell<T> , RefCell<T> , Mutex<T> and all other interior mutability types are invariant over T (as is *mut T by metaphor) To understand why these variances are correct and desirable, we will consider several examples. We have already covered why &'a T should be covariant over 'a when introducing subtyping: it's desirable to be able to pass longer-lived things where shorter-lived things are needed. Similar reasoning applies to why it should be covariant over T: it's reasonable to be able to pass &&'static str where an &&'a str is expected. The additional level of indirection doesn't change the desire to be able to pass longer lived things where shorter lived things are expected. However this logic doesn't apply to &mut . To see why &mut should be invariant over T, consider the following code: fn overwrite<T: Copy>(input: &mut T, new: &mut T) { *input = *new;\n} fn main() { let mut forever_str: &'static str = \"hello\"; { let string = String::from(\"world\"); overwrite(&mut forever_str, &mut &*string); } // Oops, printing free'd memory println!(\"{}\", forever_str);\n} The signature of overwrite is clearly valid: it takes mutable references to two values of the same type, and overwrites one with the other. But, if &mut T was covariant over T, then &mut &'static str would be a subtype of &mut &'a str , since &'static str is a subtype of &'a str . Therefore the lifetime of forever_str would successfully be \"shrunk\" down to the shorter lifetime of string , and overwrite would be called successfully. string would subsequently be dropped, and forever_str would point to freed memory when we print it! Therefore &mut should be invariant. This is the general theme of variance vs invariance: if variance would allow you to store a short-lived value in a longer-lived slot, then invariance must be used. More generally, the soundness of subtyping and variance is based on the idea that its ok to forget details, but with mutable references there's always someone (the original value being referenced) that remembers the forgotten details and will assume that those details haven't changed. If we do something to invalidate those details, the original location can behave unsoundly. However it is sound for &'a mut T to be covariant over 'a . The key difference between 'a and T is that 'a is a property of the reference itself, while T is something the reference is borrowing. If you change T's type, then the source still remembers the original type. However if you change the lifetime's type, no one but the reference knows this information, so it's fine. Put another way: &'a mut T owns 'a , but only borrows T. Box and Vec are interesting cases because they're covariant, but you can definitely store values in them! This is where Rust's typesystem allows it to be a bit more clever than others. To understand why it's sound for owning containers to be covariant over their contents, we must consider the two ways in which a mutation may occur: by-value or by-reference. If mutation is by-value, then the old location that remembers extra details is moved out of, meaning it can't use the value anymore. So we simply don't need to worry about anyone remembering dangerous details. Put another way, applying subtyping when passing by-value destroys details forever . For example, this compiles and is fine: fn get_box<'a>(str: &'a str) -> Box<&'a str> { // String literals are `&'static str`s, but it's fine for us to // \"forget\" this and let the caller think the string won't live that long. Box::new(\"hello\")\n} If mutation is by-reference, then our container is passed as &mut Vec<T> . But &mut is invariant over its value, so &mut Vec<T> is actually invariant over T . So the fact that Vec<T> is covariant over T doesn't matter at all when mutating by-reference. But being covariant still allows Box and Vec to be weakened when shared immutably. So you can pass a &Vec<&'static str> where a &Vec<&'a str> is expected. The invariance of the cell types can be seen as follows: & is like an &mut for a cell, because you can still store values in them through an & . Therefore cells must be invariant to avoid lifetime smuggling. fn is the most subtle case because they have mixed variance, and in fact are the only source of contra variance. To see why fn(T) -> U should be contravariant over T, consider the following function signature: // 'a is derived from some parent scope\nfn foo(&'a str) -> usize; This signature claims that it can handle any &str that lives at least as long as 'a . Now if this signature was co variant over &'a str , that would mean fn foo(&'static str) -> usize; could be provided in its place, as it would be a subtype. However this function has a stronger requirement: it says that it can only handle &'static str s, and nothing else. Giving &'a str s to it would be unsound, as it's free to assume that what it's given lives forever. Therefore functions definitely shouldn't be co variant over their arguments. However if we flip it around and use contra variance, it does work! If something expects a function which can handle strings that live forever, it makes perfect sense to instead provide a function that can handle strings that live for less than forever. So fn foo(&'a str) -> usize; can be passed where fn foo(&'static str) -> usize; is expected. To see why fn(T) -> U should be co variant over U, consider the following function signature: // 'a is derived from some parent scope\nfn foo(usize) -> &'a str; This signature claims that it will return something that outlives 'a . It is therefore completely reasonable to provide fn foo(usize) -> &'static str; in its place, as it does indeed return things that outlive 'a . Therefore functions are covariant over their return type. *const has the exact same semantics as & , so variance follows. *mut on the other hand can dereference to an &mut whether shared or not, so it is marked as invariant just like cells. This is all well and good for the types the standard library provides, but how is variance determined for type that you define? A struct, informally speaking, inherits the variance of its fields. If a struct Foo has a generic argument A that is used in a field a , then Foo's variance over A is exactly a 's variance. However if A is used in multiple fields: If all uses of A are covariant, then Foo is covariant over A If all uses of A are contravariant, then Foo is contravariant over A Otherwise, Foo is invariant over A use std::cell::Cell; struct Foo<'a, 'b, A: 'a, B: 'b, C, D, E, F, G, H, In, Out, Mixed> { a: &'a A, // covariant over 'a and A b: &'b mut B, // covariant over 'b and invariant over B c: *const C, // covariant over C d: *mut D, // invariant over D e: E, // covariant over E f: Vec<F>, // covariant over F g: Cell<G>, // invariant over G h1: H, // would also be variant over H except... h2: Cell<H>, // invariant over H, because invariance wins all conflicts i: fn(In) -> Out, // contravariant over In, covariant over Out k1: fn(Mixed) -> usize, // would be contravariant over Mixed except.. k2: Mixed, // invariant over Mixed, because invariance wins all conflicts\n}","breadcrumbs":"Ownership » Variance","title":"Variance","id":"subtyping.html#variance"},"ffi.html#creating-a-safe-interface":{"breadcrumbs":"Creating a safe interface","title":"Creating a safe interface","body":"The raw C API needs to be wrapped to provide memory safety and make use of higher-level concepts like vectors.

The snappy_compress and snappy_uncompress functions are more complex, since a buffer has to be allocated to hold the output too. The snappy_max_compressed_length function can be used to allocate a vector with the maximum required capacity to hold the compressed output. The vector can then be passed to the snappy_compress function as an output parameter. An output parameter is also passed to retrieve the true length after compression for setting the length. # extern crate libc;\n# use libc::{size_t, c_int};\n# unsafe fn snappy_compress(a: *const u8, b: size_t, c: *mut u8,\n# d: *mut size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_max_compressed_length(a: size_t) -> size_t { a }\n# fn main() {}\npub fn compress(src: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> { unsafe { let srclen = src.len() as size_t; let psrc = src.as_ptr(); let mut dstlen = snappy_max_compressed_length(srclen); let mut dst = Vec::with_capacity(dstlen as usize); let pdst = dst.as_mut_ptr(); snappy_compress(psrc, srclen, pdst, &mut dstlen); dst.set_len(dstlen as usize); dst }\n} Decompression is similar, because snappy stores the uncompressed size as part of the compression format and snappy_uncompressed_length will retrieve the exact buffer size required. # extern crate libc;\n# use libc::{size_t, c_int};\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompress(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# uncompressed: *mut u8,\n# uncompressed_length: *mut size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompressed_length(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# result: *mut size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# fn main() {}\npub fn uncompress(src: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>> { unsafe { let srclen = src.len() as size_t; let psrc = src.as_ptr(); let mut dstlen: size_t = 0; snappy_uncompressed_length(psrc, srclen, &mut dstlen); let mut dst = Vec::with_capacity(dstlen as usize); let pdst = dst.as_mut_ptr(); if snappy_uncompress(psrc, srclen, pdst, &mut dstlen) == 0 { dst.set_len(dstlen as usize); Some(dst) } else { None // SNAPPY_INVALID_INPUT } }\n} Then, we can add some tests to show how to use them. # extern crate libc;\n# use libc::{c_int, size_t};\n# unsafe fn snappy_compress(input: *const u8,\n# input_length: size_t,\n# compressed: *mut u8,\n# compressed_length: *mut size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompress(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# uncompressed: *mut u8,\n# uncompressed_length: *mut size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompressed_length(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# result: *mut size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# fn main() { } #[cfg(test)]\nmod tests { use super::*; #[test] fn valid() { let d = vec![0xde, 0xad, 0xd0, 0x0d]; let c: &[u8] = &compress(&d); assert!(validate_compressed_buffer(c)); assert!(uncompress(c) == Some(d)); } #[test] fn invalid() { let d = vec![0, 0, 0, 0]; assert!(!validate_compressed_buffer(&d)); assert!(uncompress(&d).is_none()); } #[test] fn empty() { let d = vec![]; assert!(!validate_compressed_buffer(&d)); assert!(uncompress(&d).is_none()); let c = compress(&d); assert!(validate_compressed_buffer(&c)); assert!(uncompress(&c) == Some(d)); }\n}","id":"ffi.html#creating-a-safe-interface"},"drop-flags.html#drop-flags":{"title":"Drop Flags","id":"drop-flags.html#drop-flags","body":"The examples in the previous section introduce an interesting problem for Rust. We have seen that it's possible to conditionally initialize, deinitialize, and reinitialize locations of memory totally safely. For Copy types, this isn't particularly notable since they're just a random pile of bits. However types with destructors are a different story: Rust needs to know whether to call a destructor whenever a variable is assigned to, or a variable goes out of scope. How can it do this with conditional initialization? Note that this is not a problem that all assignments need worry about. In particular, assigning through a dereference unconditionally drops, and assigning in a let unconditionally doesn't drop: let mut x = Box::new(0); // let makes a fresh variable, so never need to drop\nlet y = &mut x;\n*y = Box::new(1); // Deref assumes the referent is initialized, so always drops This is only a problem when overwriting a previously initialized variable or one of its subfields. It turns out that Rust actually tracks whether a type should be dropped or not at runtime . As a variable becomes initialized and uninitialized, a drop flag for that variable is toggled. When a variable might need to be dropped, this flag is evaluated to determine if it should be dropped. Of course, it is often the case that a value's initialization state can be statically known at every point in the program. If this is the case, then the compiler can theoretically generate more efficient code! For instance, straight- line code has such static drop semantics : let mut x = Box::new(0); // x was uninit; just overwrite.\nlet mut y = x; // y was uninit; just overwrite and make x uninit.\nx = Box::new(0); // x was uninit; just overwrite.\ny = x; // y was init; Drop y, overwrite it, and make x uninit! // y goes out of scope; y was init; Drop y! // x goes out of scope; x was uninit; do nothing. Similarly, branched code where all branches have the same behavior with respect to initialization has static drop semantics: # let condition = true;\nlet mut x = Box::new(0); // x was uninit; just overwrite.\nif condition { drop(x) // x gets moved out; make x uninit.\n} else { println!(\"{}\", x); drop(x) // x gets moved out; make x uninit.\n}\nx = Box::new(0); // x was uninit; just overwrite. // x goes out of scope; x was init; Drop x!

Similarly, a release access ensures that every access before it stays before it. However operations that occur after a release are free to be reordered to occur before it. When thread A releases a location in memory and then thread B subsequently acquires the same location in memory, causality is established. Every write that happened before A's release will be observed by B after its acquisition. However no causality is established with any other threads. Similarly, no causality is established if A and B access different locations in memory. Basic use of release-acquire is therefore simple: you acquire a location of memory to begin the critical section, and then release that location to end it. For instance, a simple spinlock might look like: use std::sync::Arc;\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\nuse std::thread; fn main() { let lock = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false)); // value answers \"am I locked?\" // ... distribute lock to threads somehow ... // Try to acquire the lock by setting it to true while lock.compare_and_swap(false, true, Ordering::Acquire) { } // broke out of the loop, so we successfully acquired the lock! // ... scary data accesses ... // ok we're done, release the lock lock.store(false, Ordering::Release);\n} On strongly-ordered platforms most accesses have release or acquire semantics, making release and acquire often totally free. This is not the case on weakly-ordered platforms.","title":"Acquire-Release"},"vec-final.html#the-final-code":{"id":"vec-final.html#the-final-code","body":"#![feature(ptr_internals)]\n#![feature(allocator_api)]\n#![feature(unique)] use std::ptr::{Unique, NonNull, self};\nuse std::mem;\nuse std::ops::{Deref, DerefMut};\nuse std::marker::PhantomData;\nuse std::alloc::{Alloc, GlobalAlloc, Layout, Global, oom}; struct RawVec<T> { ptr: Unique<T>, cap: usize,\n} impl<T> RawVec<T> { fn new() -> Self { // !0 is usize::MAX.

Generally, this is by establishing a happens before relationship between parts of the program and the threads that are running them. This gives the hardware and compiler room to optimize the program more aggressively where a strict happens-before relationship isn't established, but forces them to be more careful where one is established. The way we communicate these relationships are through data accesses and atomic accesses . Data accesses are the bread-and-butter of the programming world. They are fundamentally unsynchronized and compilers are free to aggressively optimize them. In particular, data accesses are free to be reordered by the compiler on the assumption that the program is single-threaded. The hardware is also free to propagate the changes made in data accesses to other threads as lazily and inconsistently as it wants. Most critically, data accesses are how data races happen. Data accesses are very friendly to the hardware and compiler, but as we've seen they offer awful semantics to try to write synchronized code with. Actually, that's too weak. It is literally impossible to write correct synchronized code using only data accesses. Atomic accesses are how we tell the hardware and compiler that our program is multi-threaded. Each atomic access can be marked with an ordering that specifies what kind of relationship it establishes with other accesses. In practice, this boils down to telling the compiler and hardware certain things they can't do. For the compiler, this largely revolves around re-ordering of instructions. For the hardware, this largely revolves around how writes are propagated to other threads.

Even if the type does, your code may ascribe additional meaning to it. For instance, an integer is certainly exception-safe, but has no semantics on its own. It's possible that code that panics could fail to correctly update the integer, producing an inconsistent program state. This is usually fine, because anything that witnesses an exception is about to get destroyed. For instance, if you send a Vec to another thread and that thread panics, it doesn't matter if the Vec is in a weird state. It will be dropped and go away forever. However some types are especially good at smuggling values across the panic boundary. These types may choose to explicitly poison themselves if they witness a panic. Poisoning doesn't entail anything in particular. Generally it just means preventing normal usage from proceeding. The most notable example of this is the standard library's Mutex type. A Mutex will poison itself if one of its MutexGuards (the thing it returns when a lock is obtained) is dropped during a panic. Any future attempts to lock the Mutex will return an Err or panic. Mutex poisons not for true safety in the sense that Rust normally cares about. It poisons as a safety-guard against blindly using the data that comes out of a Mutex that has witnessed a panic while locked. The data in such a Mutex was likely in the middle of being modified, and as such may be in an inconsistent or incomplete state. It is important to note that one cannot violate memory safety with such a type if it is correctly written. After all, it must be minimally exception-safe! However if the Mutex contained, say, a BinaryHeap that does not actually have the heap property, it's unlikely that any code that uses it will do what the author intended. As such, the program should not proceed normally. Still, if you're double-plus-sure that you can do something with the value, the Mutex exposes a method to get the lock anyway. It is safe, after all.

However up to this point we have only ever interacted with the outlives relationship in an inclusive manner. That is, when we talked about 'a: 'b , it was ok for 'a to live exactly as long as 'b . At first glance, this seems to be a meaningless distinction. Nothing ever gets dropped at the same time as another, right? This is why we used the following desugaring of let statements: let x;\nlet y; { let x; { let y; }\n} Each creates its own scope, clearly establishing that one drops before the other. However, what if we do the following? let (x, y) = (vec![], vec![]); Does either value strictly outlive the other? The answer is in fact no , neither value strictly outlives the other. Of course, one of x or y will be dropped before the other, but the actual order is not specified. Tuples aren't special in this regard; composite structures just don't guarantee their destruction order as of Rust 1.0. We could specify this for the fields of built-in composites like tuples and structs. However, what about something like Vec? Vec has to manually drop its elements via pure-library code. In general, anything that implements Drop has a chance to fiddle with its innards during its final death knell. Therefore the compiler can't sufficiently reason about the actual destruction order of the contents of any type that implements Drop. So why do we care? We care because if the type system isn't careful, it could accidentally make dangling pointers. Consider the following simple program: struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8); fn main() { let (inspector, days); days = Box::new(1); inspector = Inspector(&days);\n} This program is totally sound and compiles today. The fact that days does not strictly outlive inspector doesn't matter. As long as the inspector is alive, so is days. However if we add a destructor, the program will no longer compile! struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8); impl<'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> { fn drop(&mut self) { println!(\"I was only {} days from retirement!\", self.0); }\n} fn main() { let (inspector, days); days = Box::new(1); inspector = Inspector(&days); // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first. // Then when Inspector is dropped, it will try to read free'd memory!\n} error: `days` does not live long enough --> <anon>:15:1 |\n12 | inspector = Inspector(&days); | ---- borrow occurs here\n...\n15 | } | ^ `days` dropped here while still borrowed | = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are created error: aborting due to previous error Implementing Drop lets the Inspector execute some arbitrary code during its death. This means it can potentially observe that types that are supposed to live as long as it does actually were destroyed first. Interestingly, only generic types need to worry about this. If they aren't generic, then the only lifetimes they can harbor are 'static , which will truly live forever . This is why this problem is referred to as sound generic drop . Sound generic drop is enforced by the drop checker . As of this writing, some of the finer details of how the drop checker validates types is totally up in the air. However The Big Rule is the subtlety that we have focused on this whole section: For a generic type to soundly implement drop, its generics arguments must strictly outlive it. Obeying this rule is (usually) necessary to satisfy the borrow checker; obeying it is sufficient but not necessary to be sound. That is, if your type obeys this rule then it's definitely sound to drop. The reason that it is not always necessary to satisfy the above rule is that some Drop implementations will not access borrowed data even though their type gives them the capability for such access. For example, this variant of the above Inspector example will never access borrowed data: struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8, &'static str); impl<'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> { fn drop(&mut self) { println!(\"Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.\", self.1); }\n} fn main() { let (inspector, days); days = Box::new(1); inspector = Inspector(&days, \"gadget\"); // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first. // Even when Inspector is dropped, its destructor will not access the // borrowed `days`.\n} Likewise, this variant will also never access borrowed data: use std::fmt; struct Inspector<T: fmt::Display>(T, &'static str); impl<T: fmt::Display> Drop for Inspector<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { println!(\"Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.\", self.1); }\n} fn main() { let (inspector, days): (Inspector<&u8>, Box<u8>); days = Box::new(1); inspector = Inspector(&days, \"gadget\"); // Let's say `days` happens to get dropped first. // Even when Inspector is dropped, its destructor will not access the // borrowed `days`.\n} However, both of the above variants are rejected by the borrow checker during the analysis of fn main , saying that days does not live long enough. The reason is that the borrow checking analysis of main does not know about the internals of each Inspector 's Drop implementation. As far as the borrow checker knows while it is analyzing main , the body of an inspector's destructor might access that borrowed data. Therefore, the drop checker forces all borrowed data in a value to strictly outlive that value.","breadcrumbs":"Ownership » Drop Check"},"borrow-splitting.html#splitting-borrows":{"title":"Splitting Borrows","id":"borrow-splitting.html#splitting-borrows","breadcrumbs":"Ownership » Splitting Borrows","body":"The mutual exclusion property of mutable references can be very limiting when working with a composite structure. The borrow checker understands some basic stuff, but will fall over pretty easily. It does understand structs sufficiently to know that it's possible to borrow disjoint fields of a struct simultaneously. So this works today: struct Foo { a: i32, b: i32, c: i32,\n} let mut x = Foo {a: 0, b: 0, c: 0};\nlet a = &mut x.a;\nlet b = &mut x.b;\nlet c = &x.c;\n*b += 1;\nlet c2 = &x.c;\n*a += 10;\nprintln!(\"{} {} {} {}\", a, b, c, c2); However borrowck doesn't understand arrays or slices in any way, so this doesn't work: let mut x = [1, 2, 3];\nlet a = &mut x[0];\nlet b = &mut x[1];\nprintln!(\"{} {}\", a, b); <anon>:4:14: 4:18 error: cannot borrow `x[..]` as mutable more than once at a time\n<anon>:4 let b = &mut x[1]; ^~~~\n<anon>:3:14: 3:18 note: previous borrow of `x[..]` occurs here; the mutable borrow prevents subsequent moves, borrows, or modification of `x[..]` until the borrow ends\n<anon>:3 let a = &mut x[0]; ^~~~\n<anon>:6:2: 6:2 note: previous borrow ends here\n<anon>:1 fn main() {\n<anon>:2 let mut x = [1, 2, 3];\n<anon>:3 let a = &mut x[0];\n<anon>:4 let b = &mut x[1];\n<anon>:5 println!(\"{} {}\", a, b);\n<anon>:6 } ^\nerror: aborting due to 2 previous errors While it was plausible that borrowck could understand this simple case, it's pretty clearly hopeless for borrowck to understand disjointness in general container types like a tree, especially if distinct keys actually do map to the same value. In order to \"teach\" borrowck that what we're doing is ok, we need to drop down to unsafe code. For instance, mutable slices expose a split_at_mut function that consumes the slice and returns two mutable slices. One for everything to the left of the index, and one for everything to the right. Intuitively we know this is safe because the slices don't overlap, and therefore alias. However the implementation requires some unsafety: fn split_at_mut(&mut self, mid: usize) -> (&mut [T], &mut [T]) { let len = self.len(); let ptr = self.as_mut_ptr(); assert!(mid <= len); unsafe { (from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid), from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.offset(mid as isize), len - mid)) }\n} This is actually a bit subtle. So as to avoid ever making two &mut 's to the same value, we explicitly construct brand-new slices through raw pointers. However more subtle is how iterators that yield mutable references work. The iterator trait is defined as follows: trait Iterator { type Item; fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;\n} Given this definition, Self::Item has no connection to self . This means that we can call next several times in a row, and hold onto all the results concurrently . This is perfectly fine for by-value iterators, which have exactly these semantics. It's also actually fine for shared references, as they admit arbitrarily many references to the same thing (although the iterator needs to be a separate object from the thing being shared). But mutable references make this a mess. At first glance, they might seem completely incompatible with this API, as it would produce multiple mutable references to the same object! However it actually does work, exactly because iterators are one-shot objects. Everything an IterMut yields will be yielded at most once, so we don't actually ever yield multiple mutable references to the same piece of data. Perhaps surprisingly, mutable iterators don't require unsafe code to be implemented for many types! For instance here's a singly linked list: # fn main() {}\ntype Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>; struct Node<T> { elem: T, next: Link<T>,\n} pub struct LinkedList<T> { head: Link<T>,\n} pub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(Option<&'a mut Node<T>>); impl<T> LinkedList<T> { fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<T> { IterMut(self.head.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node)) }\n} impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> { type Item = &'a mut T; fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { self.0.take().map(|node| { self.0 = node.next.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node); &mut node.elem }) }\n} Here's a mutable slice: # fn main() {}\nuse std::mem; pub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(&'a mut[T]); impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> { type Item = &'a mut T; fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { let slice = mem::replace(&mut self.0, &mut []); if slice.is_empty() { return None; } let (l, r) = slice.split_at_mut(1); self.0 = r; l.get_mut(0) }\n} impl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for IterMut<'a, T> { fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { let slice = mem::replace(&mut self.0, &mut []); if slice.is_empty() { return None; } let new_len = slice.len() - 1; let (l, r) = slice.split_at_mut(new_len); self.0 = l; r.get_mut(0) }\n} And here's a binary tree: # fn main() {}\nuse std::collections::VecDeque; type Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>; struct Node<T> { elem: T, left: Link<T>, right: Link<T>,\n} pub struct Tree<T> { root: Link<T>,\n} struct NodeIterMut<'a, T: 'a> { elem: Option<&'a mut T>, left: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>, right: Option<&'a mut Node<T>>,\n} enum State<'a, T: 'a> { Elem(&'a mut T), Node(&'a mut Node<T>),\n} pub struct IterMut<'a, T: 'a>(VecDeque<NodeIterMut<'a, T>>); impl<T> Tree<T> { pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> IterMut<T> { let mut deque = VecDeque::new(); self.root.as_mut().map(|root| deque.push_front(root.iter_mut())); IterMut(deque) }\n} impl<T> Node<T> { pub fn iter_mut(&mut self) -> NodeIterMut<T> { NodeIterMut { elem: Some(&mut self.elem), left: self.left.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node), right: self.right.as_mut().map(|node| &mut **node), } }\n} impl<'a, T> Iterator for NodeIterMut<'a, T> { type Item = State<'a, T>; fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { match self.left.take() { Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)), None => match self.elem.take() { Some(elem) => Some(State::Elem(elem)), None => match self.right.take() { Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)), None => None, } } } }\n} impl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for NodeIterMut<'a, T> { fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { match self.right.take() { Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)), None => match self.elem.take() { Some(elem) => Some(State::Elem(elem)), None => match self.left.take() { Some(node) => Some(State::Node(node)), None => None, } } } }\n} impl<'a, T> Iterator for IterMut<'a, T> { type Item = &'a mut T; fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { loop { match self.0.front_mut().and_then(|node_it| node_it.next()) { Some(State::Elem(elem)) => return Some(elem), Some(State::Node(node)) => self.0.push_front(node.iter_mut()), None => if let None = self.0.pop_front() { return None }, } } }\n} impl<'a, T> DoubleEndedIterator for IterMut<'a, T> { fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { loop { match self.0.back_mut().and_then(|node_it| node_it.next_back()) { Some(State::Elem(elem)) => return Some(elem), Some(State::Node(node)) => self.0.push_back(node.iter_mut()), None => if let None = self.0.pop_back() { return None }, } } }\n} All of these are completely safe and work on stable Rust! This ultimately falls out of the simple struct case we saw before: Rust understands that you can safely split a mutable reference into subfields. We can then encode permanently consuming a reference via Options (or in the case of slices, replacing with an empty slice)."},"coercions.html#coercions":{"body":"Types can implicitly be coerced to change in certain contexts.

Data races are mostly prevented through rust's ownership system: it's impossible to alias a mutable reference, so it's impossible to perform a data race. Interior mutability makes this more complicated, which is largely why we have the Send and Sync traits (see below). However Rust does not prevent general race conditions. This is pretty fundamentally impossible, and probably honestly undesirable. Your hardware is racy, your OS is racy, the other programs on your computer are racy, and the world this all runs in is racy.

It allows Rust to be completely memory-safe and efficient, while avoiding garbage collection. Before getting into the ownership system in detail, we will consider the motivation of this design. We will assume that you accept that garbage collection (GC) is not always an optimal solution, and that it is desirable to manually manage memory in some contexts. If you do not accept this, might I interest you in a different language? Regardless of your feelings on GC, it is pretty clearly a massive boon to making code safe. You never have to worry about things going away too soon (although whether you still wanted to be pointing at that thing is a different issue...). This is a pervasive problem that C and C++ programs need to deal with. Consider this simple mistake that all of us who have used a non-GC'd language have made at one point: fn as_str(data: &u32) -> &str { // compute the string let s = format!(\"{}\", data); // OH NO! We returned a reference to something that // exists only in this function! // Dangling pointer! Use after free! Alas! // (this does not compile in Rust) &s\n} This is exactly what Rust's ownership system was built to solve. Rust knows the scope in which the &s lives, and as such can prevent it from escaping. However this is a simple case that even a C compiler could plausibly catch. Things get more complicated as code gets bigger and pointers get fed through various functions. Eventually, a C compiler will fall down and won't be able to perform sufficient escape analysis to prove your code unsound. It will consequently be forced to accept your program on the assumption that it is correct. This will never happen to Rust. It's up to the programmer to prove to the compiler that everything is sound. Of course, Rust's story around ownership is much more complicated than just verifying that references don't escape the scope of their referent. That's because ensuring pointers are always valid is much more complicated than this. For instance in this code, let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];\n// get an internal reference\nlet x = &data[0]; // OH NO! `push` causes the backing storage of `data` to be reallocated.\n// Dangling pointer!

This most commonly occurs with lifetimes. For instance, the Iter for &'a [T] is (approximately) defined as follows: struct Iter<'a, T: 'a> { ptr: *const T, end: *const T,\n} However because 'a is unused within the struct's body, it's unbounded . Because of the troubles this has historically caused, unbounded lifetimes and types are forbidden in struct definitions. Therefore we must somehow refer to these types in the body. Correctly doing this is necessary to have correct variance and drop checking. We do this using PhantomData , which is a special marker type. PhantomData consumes no space, but simulates a field of the given type for the purpose of static analysis. This was deemed to be less error-prone than explicitly telling the type-system the kind of variance that you want, while also providing other useful such as the information needed by drop check. Iter logically contains a bunch of &'a T s, so this is exactly what we tell the PhantomData to simulate: use std::marker; struct Iter<'a, T: 'a> { ptr: *const T, end: *const T, _marker: marker::PhantomData<&'a T>,\n} and that's it. The lifetime will be bounded, and your iterator will be variant over 'a and T . Everything Just Works. Another important example is Vec, which is (approximately) defined as follows: struct Vec<T> { data: *const T, // *const for variance! len: usize, cap: usize,\n} Unlike the previous example, it appears that everything is exactly as we want. Every generic argument to Vec shows up in at least one field. Good to go! Nope. The drop checker will generously determine that Vec<T> does not own any values of type T. This will in turn make it conclude that it doesn't need to worry about Vec dropping any T's in its destructor for determining drop check soundness. This will in turn allow people to create unsoundness using Vec's destructor. In order to tell dropck that we do own values of type T, and therefore may drop some T's when we drop, we must add an extra PhantomData saying exactly that: use std::marker; struct Vec<T> { data: *const T, // *const for variance! len: usize, cap: usize, _marker: marker::PhantomData<T>,\n} Raw pointers that own an allocation is such a pervasive pattern that the standard library made a utility for itself called Unique<T> which: wraps a *const T for variance includes a PhantomData<T> auto-derives Send / Sync as if T was contained marks the pointer as NonZero for the null-pointer optimization","id":"phantom-data.html#phantomdata"},"concurrency.html#concurrency-and-parallelism":{"title":"Concurrency and Parallelism","body":"Rust as a language doesn't really have an opinion on how to do concurrency or parallelism.

Due to their lack of a statically known size, these types can only exist behind some kind of pointer. Any pointer to a DST consequently becomes a fat pointer consisting of the pointer and the information that \"completes\" them (more on this below). There are two major DSTs exposed by the language: trait objects, and slices. A trait object represents some type that implements the traits it specifies.

This is the information that completes a trait object: a pointer to its vtable. A slice is simply a view into some contiguous storage -- typically an array or Vec .

How do they interact? The separation between Safe Rust and Unsafe Rust is controlled with the unsafe keyword, which acts as an interface from one to the other. This is why we can say Safe Rust is a safe language: all the unsafe parts are kept exclusively behind the unsafe boundary. If you wish, you can even toss #![forbid(unsafe_code)] into your code base to statically guarantee that you're only writing Safe Rust. The unsafe keyword has two uses: to declare the existence of contracts the compiler can't check, and to declare that a programmer has checked that these contracts have been upheld. You can use unsafe to indicate the existence of unchecked contracts on functions and trait declarations . On functions, unsafe means that users of the function must check that function's documentation to ensure they are using it in a way that maintains the contracts the function requires. On trait declarations, unsafe means that implementors of the trait must check the trait documentation to ensure their implementation maintains the contracts the trait requires. You can use unsafe on a block to declare that all unsafe actions performed within are verified to uphold the contracts of those operations. For instance, the index passed to slice::get_unchecked is in-bounds. You can use unsafe on a trait implementation to declare that the implementation upholds the trait's contract. For instance, that a type implementing Send is really safe to move to another thread. The standard library has a number of unsafe functions, including: slice::get_unchecked , which performs unchecked indexing, allowing memory safety to be freely violated. mem::transmute reinterprets some value as having a given type, bypassing type safety in arbitrary ways (see conversions for details). Every raw pointer to a sized type has an offset method that invokes Undefined Behavior if the passed offset is not \"in bounds\" . All FFI (Foreign Function Interface) functions are unsafe to call because the other language can do arbitrary operations that the Rust compiler can't check. As of Rust 1.0 there are exactly two unsafe traits: Send is a marker trait (a trait with no API) that promises implementors are safe to send (move) to another thread. Sync is a marker trait that promises threads can safely share implementors through a shared reference. Much of the Rust standard library also uses Unsafe Rust internally. These implementations have generally been rigorously manually checked, so the Safe Rust interfaces built on top of these implementations can be assumed to be safe. The need for all of this separation boils down a single fundamental property of Safe Rust: No matter what, Safe Rust can't cause Undefined Behavior. The design of the safe/unsafe split means that there is an asymmetric trust relationship between Safe and Unsafe Rust. Safe Rust inherently has to trust that any Unsafe Rust it touches has been written correctly. On the other hand, Unsafe Rust has to be very careful about trusting Safe Rust. As an example, Rust has the PartialOrd and Ord traits to differentiate between types which can \"just\" be compared, and those that provide a \"total\" ordering (which basically means that comparison behaves reasonably). BTreeMap doesn't really make sense for partially-ordered types, and so it requires that its keys implement Ord . However, BTreeMap has Unsafe Rust code inside of its implementation. Because it would be unacceptable for a sloppy Ord implementation (which is Safe to write) to cause Undefined Behavior, the Unsafe code in BTreeMap must be written to be robust against Ord implementations which aren't actually total — even though that's the whole point of requiring Ord . The Unsafe Rust code just can't trust the Safe Rust code to be written correctly. That said, BTreeMap will still behave completely erratically if you feed in values that don't have a total ordering. It just won't ever cause Undefined Behavior. One may wonder, if BTreeMap cannot trust Ord because it's Safe, why can it trust any Safe code? For instance BTreeMap relies on integers and slices to be implemented correctly. Those are safe too, right? The difference is one of scope. When BTreeMap relies on integers and slices, it's relying on one very specific implementation. This is a measured risk that can be weighed against the benefit. In this case there's basically zero risk; if integers and slices are broken, everyone is broken. Also, they're maintained by the same people who maintain BTreeMap , so it's easy to keep tabs on them. On the other hand, BTreeMap 's key type is generic. Trusting its Ord implementation means trusting every Ord implementation in the past, present, and future. Here the risk is high: someone somewhere is going to make a mistake and mess up their Ord implementation, or even just straight up lie about providing a total ordering because \"it seems to work\". When that happens, BTreeMap needs to be prepared. The same logic applies to trusting a closure that's passed to you to behave correctly. This problem of unbounded generic trust is the problem that unsafe traits exist to resolve. The BTreeMap type could theoretically require that keys implement a new trait called UnsafeOrd , rather than Ord , that might look like this: use std::cmp::Ordering; unsafe trait UnsafeOrd { fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;\n} Then, a type would use unsafe to implement UnsafeOrd , indicating that they've ensured their implementation maintains whatever contracts the trait expects. In this situation, the Unsafe Rust in the internals of BTreeMap would be justified in trusting that the key type's UnsafeOrd implementation is correct. If it isn't, it's the fault of the unsafe trait implementation, which is consistent with Rust's safety guarantees. The decision of whether to mark a trait unsafe is an API design choice. Rust has traditionally avoided doing this because it makes Unsafe Rust pervasive, which isn't desirable. Send and Sync are marked unsafe because thread safety is a fundamental property that unsafe code can't possibly hope to defend against in the way it could defend against a bad Ord implementation. The decision of whether to mark your own traits unsafe depends on the same sort of consideration. If unsafe code can't reasonably expect to defend against a bad implementation of the trait, then marking the trait unsafe is a reasonable choice. As an aside, while Send and Sync are unsafe traits, they are also automatically implemented for types when such derivations are provably safe to do. Send is automatically derived for all types composed only of values whose types also implement Send . Sync is automatically derived for all types composed only of values whose types also implement Sync . This minimizes the pervasive unsafety of making these two traits unsafe . This is the balance between Safe and Unsafe Rust. The separation is designed to make using Safe Rust as ergonomic as possible, but requires extra effort and care when writing Unsafe Rust. The rest of this book is largely a discussion of the sort of care that must be taken, and what contracts Unsafe Rust must uphold."},"meet-safe-and-unsafe.html#meet-safe-and-unsafe":{"title":"Meet Safe and Unsafe","body":"safe and unsafe It would be great to not have to worry about low-level implementation details. Who could possibly care how much space the empty tuple occupies? Sadly, it sometimes matters and we need to worry about it. The most common reason developers start to care about implementation details is performance, but more importantly, these details can become a matter of correctness when interfacing directly with hardware, operating systems, or other languages. When implementation details start to matter in a safe programming language, programmers usually have three options: fiddle with the code to encourage the compiler/runtime to perform an optimization adopt a more unidiomatic or cumbersome design to get the desired implementation rewrite the implementation in a language that lets you deal with those details For that last option, the language programmers tend to use is C . This is often necessary to interface with systems that only declare a C interface. Unfortunately, C is incredibly unsafe to use (sometimes for good reason), and this unsafety is magnified when trying to interoperate with another language. Care must be taken to ensure C and the other language agree on what's happening, and that they don't step on each other's toes. So what does this have to do with Rust? Well, unlike C, Rust is a safe programming language. But, like C, Rust is an unsafe programming language. More accurately, Rust contains both a safe and unsafe programming language. Rust can be thought of as a combination of two programming languages: Safe Rust and Unsafe Rust . Conveniently, these names mean exactly what they say: Safe Rust is Safe. Unsafe Rust is, well, not.

If all you do is write Safe Rust, you will never have to worry about type-safety or memory-safety. You will never endure a dangling pointer, a use-after-free, or any other kind of Undefined Behavior. The standard library also gives you enough utilities out of the box that you'll be able to write high-performance applications and libraries in pure idiomatic Safe Rust. But maybe you want to talk to another language. Maybe you're writing a low-level abstraction not exposed by the standard library. Maybe you're writing the standard library (which is written entirely in Rust). Maybe you need to do something the type-system doesn't understand and just frob some dang bits . Maybe you need Unsafe Rust. Unsafe Rust is exactly like Safe Rust with all the same rules and semantics. It just lets you do some extra things that are Definitely Not Safe (which we will define in the next section). The value of this separation is that we gain the benefits of using an unsafe language like C — low level control over implementation details — without most of the problems that come with trying to integrate it with a completely different safe language. There are still some problems — most notably, we must become aware of properties that the type system assumes and audit them in any code that interacts with Unsafe Rust. That's the purpose of this book: to teach you about these assumptions and how to manage them.","id":"meet-safe-and-unsafe.html#meet-safe-and-unsafe","breadcrumbs":"Meet Safe and Unsafe"},"README.html#note-this-is-a-draft-document-that-discusses-several-unstable-aspects-of-rust-and-may-contain-serious-errors-or-outdated-information":{"body":"Instead of the programs I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering blackness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe before — the unwhisperable secret of secrets — The fact that this language of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Rust as London is of Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite unsafe, its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in compilation. This book digs into all the awful details that are necessary to understand in order to write correct Unsafe Rust programs. Due to the nature of this problem, it may lead to unleashing untold horrors that shatter your psyche into a billion infinitesimal fragments of despair. Should you wish a long and happy career of writing Rust programs, you should turn back now and forget you ever saw this book. It is not necessary. However if you intend to write unsafe code — or just want to dig into the guts of the language — this book contains lots of useful information. Unlike The Rust Programming Language , we will be assuming considerable prior knowledge. In particular, you should be comfortable with basic systems programming and Rust. If you don't feel comfortable with these topics, you should consider reading The Book first. That said, we won't assume you have read it, and we will take care to occasionally give a refresher on the basics where appropriate. You can skip straight to this book if you want; just know that we won't be explaining everything from the ground up. We're going to dig into exception-safety, pointer aliasing, memory models, compiler and hardware implementation details, and even some type-theory. Much text will be devoted to exotic corner cases that no one should ever have to care about, but suddenly become important because we wrote unsafe .

The alignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A value of alignment n must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of n . So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means that you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power of 2. Most primitives are generally aligned to their size, although this is platform-specific behavior. In particular, on x86 u64 and f64 may be only aligned to 32 bits. A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment. This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed by offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a type may not be known statically in the case of dynamically sized types . Rust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data: structs (named product types) tuples (anonymous product types) arrays (homogeneous product types) enums (named sum types -- tagged unions) An enum is said to be field-less if none of its variants have associated data. Composite structures will have an alignment equal to the maximum of their fields' alignment. Rust will consequently insert padding where necessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall type's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance: struct A { a: u8, b: u32, c: u16,\n} will be 32-bit aligned on an architecture that aligns these primitives to their respective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple of 32-bits. It will potentially become: struct A { a: u8, _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align `b` b: u32, c: u16, _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n} There is no indirection for these types; all data is stored within the struct, as you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are densely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not by default specified in Rust. Given the two following struct definitions: struct A { a: i32, b: u64,\n} struct B { a: i32, b: u64,\n} Rust does guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in exactly the same way. However Rust does not currently guarantee that an instance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B, though in practice there's no reason why they wouldn't. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other features of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in complex ways. For instance, consider this struct: struct Foo<T, U> { count: u16, data1: T, data2: U,\n} Now consider the monomorphizations of Foo<u32, u16> and Foo<u16, u32> . If Rust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the values in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust didn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following: struct Foo<u16, u32> { count: u16, data1: u16, data2: u32,\n} struct Foo<u32, u16> { count: u16, _pad1: u16, data1: u32, data2: u16, _pad2: u16,\n} The latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space therefore requires different monomorphizations to have different field orderings . Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as: enum Foo { A(u32), B(u64), C(u8),\n} would be laid out as: struct FooRepr { data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag` tag: u8, // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n} And indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out in general (modulo the size and position of tag ). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The classic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting of a single outer unit variant (e.g. None ) and a (potentially nested) non- nullable pointer variant (e.g. &T ) makes the tag unnecessary, because a null pointer value can safely be interpreted to mean that the unit variant is chosen instead. The net result is that, for example, size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>() . There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as Box<T> , Vec<T> , String , &T , and &mut T . Similarly, one can imagine nested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by definition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could use fairly elaborate algorithms to cache bits throughout nested types with special constrained representations. As such it is especially desirable that we leave enum layout unspecified today."},"vec-drain.html#drain":{"breadcrumbs":"Implementing Vec » Drain","id":"vec-drain.html#drain","body":"Let's move on to Drain.

These types can only be talked about at the type level, and never at the value level. Empty types can be declared by specifying an enum with no variants: enum Void {} // No variants = EMPTY Empty types are even more marginal than ZSTs. The primary motivating example for Void types is type-level unreachability. For instance, suppose an API needs to return a Result in general, but a specific case actually is infallible. It's actually possible to communicate this at the type level by returning a Result<T, Void> . Consumers of the API can confidently unwrap such a Result knowing that it's statically impossible for this value to be an Err , as this would require providing a value of type Void . In principle, Rust can do some interesting analyses and optimizations based on this fact. For instance, Result<T, Void> could be represented as just T , because the Err case doesn't actually exist. The following could also compile: enum Void {} let res: Result<u32, Void> = Ok(0); // Err doesn't exist anymore, so Ok is actually irrefutable.\nlet Ok(num) = res; But neither of these tricks work today, so all Void types get you is the ability to be confident that certain situations are statically impossible. One final subtle detail about empty types is that raw pointers to them are actually valid to construct, but dereferencing them is Undefined Behavior because that doesn't actually make sense.

We could backshift all the elements in the Vec every time we remove a value, but this would have pretty catastrophic performance consequences. Instead, we would like Drain to fix the Vec's backing storage when it is dropped. It should run itself to completion, backshift any elements that weren't removed (drain supports subranges), and then fix Vec's len . It's even unwinding-safe! Easy!

Unfortunately, we're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place: maintaining consistent state at every step has an enormous cost (and would negate any benefits of the API). Failing to maintain consistent state gives us Undefined Behavior in safe code (making the API unsound). So what can we do? Well, we can pick a trivially consistent state: set the Vec's len to be 0 when we start the iteration, and fix it up if necessary in the destructor. That way, if everything executes like normal we get the desired behavior with minimal overhead. But if someone has the audacity to mem::forget us in the middle of the iteration, all that does is leak even more (and possibly leave the Vec in an unexpected but otherwise consistent state).

When interfacing with C, pointers that might be null are often used, which would seem to require some messy transmute s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, the language provides a workaround. As a special case, an enum is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains exactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the non-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather, the empty variant is represented by putting a null value into the non-nullable field. This is called an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible types. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is Option<T> , where None corresponds to null . So Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int> is a correct way to represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type int (*)(int) ). Here is a contrived example. Let's say some C library has a facility for registering a callback, which gets called in certain situations.

The current analysis is deliberately conservative and trivial; it forces all borrowed data in a value to outlive that value, which is certainly sound. Future versions of the language may make the analysis more precise, to reduce the number of cases where sound code is rejected as unsafe. This would help address cases such as the two Inspector s above that know not to inspect during destruction. In the meantime, there is an unstable attribute that one can use to assert (unsafely) that a generic type's destructor is guaranteed to not access any expired data, even if its type gives it the capability to do so. That attribute is called may_dangle and was introduced in RFC 1327 . To deploy it on the Inspector example from above, we would write: struct Inspector<'a>(&'a u8, &'static str); unsafe impl<#[may_dangle] 'a> Drop for Inspector<'a> { fn drop(&mut self) { println!(\"Inspector(_, {}) knows when *not* to inspect.\", self.1); }\n} Use of this attribute requires the Drop impl to be marked unsafe because the compiler is not checking the implicit assertion that no potentially expired data (e.g. self.0 above) is accessed. The attribute can be applied to any number of lifetime and type parameters. In the following example, we assert that we access no data behind a reference of lifetime 'b and that the only uses of T will be moves or drops, but omit the attribute from 'a and U , because we do access data with that lifetime and that type: use std::fmt::Display; struct Inspector<'a, 'b, T, U: Display>(&'a u8, &'b u8, T, U); unsafe impl<'a, #[may_dangle] 'b, #[may_dangle] T, U: Display> Drop for Inspector<'a, 'b, T, U> { fn drop(&mut self) { println!(\"Inspector({}, _, _, {})\", self.0, self.3); }\n} It is sometimes obvious that no such access can occur, like the case above. However, when dealing with a generic type parameter, such access can occur indirectly. Examples of such indirect access are: invoking a callback, via a trait method call. (Future changes to the language, such as impl specialization, may add other avenues for such indirect access.) Here is an example of invoking a callback: struct Inspector<T>(T, &'static str, Box<for <'r> fn(&'r T) -> String>); impl<T> Drop for Inspector<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { // The `self.2` call could access a borrow e.g. if `T` is `&'a _`. println!(\"Inspector({}, {}) unwittingly inspects expired data.\", (self.2)(&self.0), self.1); }\n} Here is an example of a trait method call: use std::fmt; struct Inspector<T: fmt::Display>(T, &'static str); impl<T: fmt::Display> Drop for Inspector<T> { fn drop(&mut self) { // There is a hidden call to `<T as Display>::fmt` below, which // could access a borrow e.g. if `T` is `&'a _` println!(\"Inspector({}, {}) unwittingly inspects expired data.\", self.0, self.1); }\n} And of course, all of these accesses could be further hidden within some other method invoked by the destructor, rather than being written directly within it. In all of the above cases where the &'a u8 is accessed in the destructor, adding the #[may_dangle] attribute makes the type vulnerable to misuse that the borrower checker will not catch, inviting havoc. It is better to avoid adding the attribute.","breadcrumbs":"Ownership » An Escape Hatch"},"leaking.html#leaking":{"id":"leaking.html#leaking","body":"Ownership-based resource management is intended to simplify composition. You acquire resources when you create the object, and you release the resources when it gets destroyed. Since destruction is handled for you, it means you can't forget to release the resources, and it happens as soon as possible! Surely this is perfect and all of our problems are solved. Everything is terrible and we have new and exotic problems to try to solve. Many people like to believe that Rust eliminates resource leaks. In practice, this is basically true. You would be surprised to see a Safe Rust program leak resources in an uncontrolled way. However from a theoretical perspective this is absolutely not the case, no matter how you look at it. In the strictest sense, \"leaking\" is so abstract as to be unpreventable. It's quite trivial to initialize a collection at the start of a program, fill it with tons of objects with destructors, and then enter an infinite event loop that never refers to it. The collection will sit around uselessly, holding on to its precious resources until the program terminates (at which point all those resources would have been reclaimed by the OS anyway). We may consider a more restricted form of leak: failing to drop a value that is unreachable. Rust also doesn't prevent this. In fact Rust has a function for doing this : mem::forget . This function consumes the value it is passed and then doesn't run its destructor . In the past mem::forget was marked as unsafe as a sort of lint against using it, since failing to call a destructor is generally not a well-behaved thing to do (though useful for some special unsafe code). However this was generally determined to be an untenable stance to take: there are many ways to fail to call a destructor in safe code. The most famous example is creating a cycle of reference-counted pointers using interior mutability. It is reasonable for safe code to assume that destructor leaks do not happen, as any program that leaks destructors is probably wrong. However unsafe code cannot rely on destructors to be run in order to be safe. For most types this doesn't matter: if you leak the destructor then the type is by definition inaccessible, so it doesn't matter, right? For instance, if you leak a Box<u8> then you waste some memory but that's hardly going to violate memory-safety. However where we must be careful with destructor leaks are proxy types. These are types which manage access to a distinct object, but don't actually own it. Proxy objects are quite rare. Proxy objects you'll need to care about are even rarer.

Sometimes some C/C++ glue is needed when writing some Rust code, but distribution of the C/C++ code in a library format is a burden. In this case, the code will be archived into libfoo.a and then the Rust crate would declare a dependency via #[link(name = \"foo\", kind = \"static\")] . Regardless of the flavor of output for the crate, the native static library will be included in the output, meaning that distribution of the native static library is not necessary. A normal dynamic dependency. Common system libraries (like readline ) are available on a large number of systems, and often a static copy of these libraries cannot be found. When this dependency is included in a Rust crate, partial targets (like rlibs) will not link to the library, but when the rlib is included in a final target (like a binary), the native library will be linked in. On macOS, frameworks behave with the same semantics as a dynamic library.","breadcrumbs":"Linking","title":"Linking"},"atomics.html#hardware-reordering":{"title":"Hardware Reordering","id":"atomics.html#hardware-reordering","body":"On the other hand, even if the compiler totally understood what we wanted and respected our wishes, our hardware might instead get us in trouble. Trouble comes from CPUs in the form of memory hierarchies. There is indeed a global shared memory space somewhere in your hardware, but from the perspective of each CPU core it is so very far away and so very slow . Each CPU would rather work with its local cache of the data and only go through all the anguish of talking to shared memory only when it doesn't actually have that memory in cache. After all, that's the whole point of the cache, right? If every read from the cache had to run back to shared memory to double check that it hadn't changed, what would the point be? The end result is that the hardware doesn't guarantee that events that occur in the same order on one thread, occur in the same order on another thread. To guarantee this, we must issue special instructions to the CPU telling it to be a bit less smart. For instance, say we convince the compiler to emit this logic: initial state: x = 0, y = 1 THREAD 1 THREAD2\ny = 3; if x == 1 {\nx = 1; y *= 2; } Ideally this program has 2 possible final states: y = 3 : (thread 2 did the check before thread 1 completed) y = 6 : (thread 2 did the check after thread 1 completed) However there's a third potential state that the hardware enables: y = 2 : (thread 2 saw x = 1 , but not y = 3 , and then overwrote y = 3 ) It's worth noting that different kinds of CPU provide different guarantees. It is common to separate hardware into two categories: strongly-ordered and weakly- ordered. Most notably x86/64 provides strong ordering guarantees, while ARM provides weak ordering guarantees. This has two consequences for concurrent programming: Asking for stronger guarantees on strongly-ordered hardware may be cheap or even free because they already provide strong guarantees unconditionally. Weaker guarantees may only yield performance wins on weakly-ordered hardware. Asking for guarantees that are too weak on strongly-ordered hardware is more likely to happen to work, even though your program is strictly incorrect. If possible, concurrent algorithms should be tested on weakly-ordered hardware.","breadcrumbs":"Concurrency » Hardware Reordering"},"ffi.html#foreign-calling-conventions":{"id":"ffi.html#foreign-calling-conventions","title":"Foreign calling conventions","breadcrumbs":"Foreign calling conventions","body":"Most foreign code exposes a C ABI, and Rust uses the platform's C calling convention by default when calling foreign functions.

The most common and easy to understand example of this can be found in languages with inheritance. Consider an Animal type which has an eat() method, and a Cat type which extends Animal, adding a meow() method. Without subtyping, if someone were to write a feed(Animal) function, they wouldn't be able to pass a Cat to this function, because a Cat isn't exactly an Animal. But being able to pass a Cat where an Animal is expected seems fairly reasonable. After all, a Cat is just an Animal and more . Something having extra features that can be ignored shouldn't be any impediment to using it! This is exactly what subtyping lets us do. Because a Cat is an Animal and more we say that Cat is a subtype of Animal. We then say that anywhere a value of a certain type is expected, a value with a subtype can also be supplied. Ok actually it's a lot more complicated and subtle than that, but that's the basic intuition that gets you by in 99% of the cases. We'll cover why it's only 99% later in this section. Although Rust doesn't have any notion of structural inheritance, it does include subtyping. In Rust, subtyping derives entirely from lifetimes. Since lifetimes are regions of code, we can partially order them based on the contains (outlives) relationship. Subtyping on lifetimes is in terms of that relationship: if 'big: 'small (\"big contains small\" or \"big outlives small\"), then 'big is a subtype of 'small . This is a large source of confusion, because it seems backwards to many: the bigger region is a subtype of the smaller region. But it makes sense if you consider our Animal example: Cat is an Animal and more , just as 'big is 'small and more . Put another way, if someone wants a reference that lives for 'small , usually what they actually mean is that they want a reference that lives for at least 'small . They don't actually care if the lifetimes match exactly. For this reason 'static , the forever lifetime, is a subtype of every lifetime. Higher-ranked lifetimes are also subtypes of every concrete lifetime. This is because taking an arbitrary lifetime is strictly more general than taking a specific one. (The typed-ness of lifetimes is a fairly arbitrary construct that some disagree with. However it simplifies our analysis to treat lifetimes and types uniformly.) However you can't write a function that takes a value of type 'a ! Lifetimes are always just part of another type, so we need a way of handling that. To handle it, we need to talk about variance .","breadcrumbs":"Ownership » Subtyping and Variance"},"working-with-unsafe.html#working-with-unsafe":{"id":"working-with-unsafe.html#working-with-unsafe","title":"Working with Unsafe","breadcrumbs":"Meet Safe and Unsafe » Working with Unsafe","body":"Rust generally only gives us the tools to talk about Unsafe Rust in a scoped and binary manner. Unfortunately, reality is significantly more complicated than that. For instance, consider the following toy function: fn index(idx: usize, arr: &[u8]) -> Option<u8> { if idx < arr.len() { unsafe { Some(*arr.get_unchecked(idx)) } } else { None }\n} This function is safe and correct. We check that the index is in bounds, and if it is, index into the array in an unchecked manner. But even in such a trivial function, the scope of the unsafe block is questionable. Consider changing the < to a <= : fn index(idx: usize, arr: &[u8]) -> Option<u8> { if idx <= arr.len() { unsafe { Some(*arr.get_unchecked(idx)) } } else { None }\n} This program is now unsound, and yet we only modified safe code . This is the fundamental problem of safety: it's non-local. The soundness of our unsafe operations necessarily depends on the state established by otherwise \"safe\" operations. Safety is modular in the sense that opting into unsafety doesn't require you to consider arbitrary other kinds of badness. For instance, doing an unchecked index into a slice doesn't mean you suddenly need to worry about the slice being null or containing uninitialized memory. Nothing fundamentally changes. However safety isn't modular in the sense that programs are inherently stateful and your unsafe operations may depend on arbitrary other state. This non-locality gets much worse when we incorporate actual persistent state. Consider a simple implementation of Vec : use std::ptr; // Note: This definition is naive. See the chapter on implementing Vec.\npub struct Vec<T> { ptr: *mut T, len: usize, cap: usize,\n} // Note this implementation does not correctly handle zero-sized types.\n// See the chapter on implementing Vec.\nimpl<T> Vec<T> { pub fn push(&mut self, elem: T) { if self.len == self.cap { // not important for this example self.reallocate(); } unsafe { ptr::write(self.ptr.offset(self.len as isize), elem); self.len += 1; } } # fn reallocate(&mut self) { }\n} # fn main() {} This code is simple enough to reasonably audit and informally verify. Now consider adding the following method: fn make_room(&mut self) { // grow the capacity self.cap += 1;\n} This code is 100% Safe Rust but it is also completely unsound. Changing the capacity violates the invariants of Vec (that cap reflects the allocated space in the Vec). This is not something the rest of Vec can guard against. It has to trust the capacity field because there's no way to verify it. Because it relies on invariants of a struct field, this unsafe code does more than pollute a whole function: it pollutes a whole module . Generally, the only bullet-proof way to limit the scope of unsafe code is at the module boundary with privacy. However this works perfectly . The existence of make_room is not a problem for the soundness of Vec because we didn't mark it as public. Only the module that defines this function can call it. Also, make_room directly accesses the private fields of Vec, so it can only be written in the same module as Vec. It is therefore possible for us to write a completely safe abstraction that relies on complex invariants. This is critical to the relationship between Safe Rust and Unsafe Rust. We have already seen that Unsafe code must trust some Safe code, but shouldn't trust generic Safe code. Privacy is important to unsafe code for similar reasons: it prevents us from having to trust all the safe code in the universe from messing with our trusted state.

There are two common problems with typing bits: needing to reinterpret those exact bits as a different type, and needing to change the bits to have equivalent meaning for a different type. Because Rust encourages encoding important properties in the type system, these problems are incredibly pervasive. As such, Rust consequently gives you several ways to solve them. First we'll look at the ways that Safe Rust gives you to reinterpret values. The most trivial way to do this is to just destructure a value into its constituent parts and then build a new type out of them. e.g. struct Foo { x: u32, y: u16,\n} struct Bar { a: u32, b: u16,\n} fn reinterpret(foo: Foo) -> Bar { let Foo { x, y } = foo; Bar { a: x, b: y }\n} But this is, at best, annoying.

We can initialize. We can allocate. Let's actually implement some functionality! Let's start with push . All it needs to do is check if we're full to grow, unconditionally write to the next index, and then increment our length. To do the write we have to be careful not to evaluate the memory we want to write to. At worst, it's truly uninitialized memory from the allocator. At best it's the bits of some old value we popped off. Either way, we can't just index to the memory and dereference it, because that will evaluate the memory as a valid instance of T. Worse, foo[idx] = x will try to call drop on the old value of foo[idx] ! The correct way to do this is with ptr::write , which just blindly overwrites the target address with the bits of the value we provide. No evaluation involved. For push , if the old len (before push was called) is 0, then we want to write to the 0th index. So we should offset by the old len. pub fn push(&mut self, elem: T) { if self.len == self.cap { self.grow(); } unsafe { ptr::write(self.ptr.offset(self.len as isize), elem); } // Can't fail, we'll OOM first. self.len += 1;\n} Easy! How about pop ? Although this time the index we want to access is initialized, Rust won't just let us dereference the location of memory to move the value out, because that would leave the memory uninitialized! For this we need ptr::read , which just copies out the bits from the target address and interprets it as a value of type T. This will leave the memory at this address logically uninitialized, even though there is in fact a perfectly good instance of T there. For pop , if the old len is 1, we want to read out of the 0th index. So we should offset by the new len. pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> { if self.len == 0 { None } else { self.len -= 1; unsafe { Some(ptr::read(self.ptr.offset(self.len as isize))) } }\n}"},"ffi.html#calling-foreign-functions":{"id":"ffi.html#calling-foreign-functions","breadcrumbs":"Calling foreign functions","title":"Calling foreign functions","body":"The following is a minimal example of calling a foreign function which will compile if snappy is installed: extern crate libc;\nuse libc::size_t; #[link(name = \"snappy\")]\nextern { fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t;\n} fn main() { let x = unsafe { snappy_max_compressed_length(100) }; println!(\"max compressed length of a 100 byte buffer: {}\", x);\n} The extern block is a list of function signatures in a foreign library, in this case with the platform's C ABI.

Foreign functions are assumed to be unsafe so calls to them need to be wrapped with unsafe {} as a promise to the compiler that everything contained within truly is safe.

It has fairly simple intent: do what C does. The order, size, and alignment of fields is exactly what you would expect from C or C++. Any type you expect to pass through an FFI boundary should have repr(C) , as C is the lingua-franca of the programming world. This is also necessary to soundly do more elaborate tricks with data layout such as reinterpreting values as a different type. However, the interaction with Rust's more exotic data layout features must be kept in mind. Due to its dual purpose as \"for FFI\" and \"for layout control\", repr(C) can be applied to types that will be nonsensical or problematic if passed through the FFI boundary. ZSTs are still zero-sized, even though this is not a standard behavior in C, and is explicitly contrary to the behavior of an empty type in C++, which still consumes a byte of space. DST pointers (fat pointers), tuples, and enums with fields are not a concept in C, and as such are never FFI-safe. If T is an FFI-safe non-nullable pointer type , Option<T> is guaranteed to have the same layout and ABI as T and is therefore also FFI-safe. As of this writing, this covers & , &mut , and function pointers, all of which can never be null. Tuple structs are like structs with regards to repr(C) , as the only difference from a struct is that the fields aren’t named. This is equivalent to one of repr(u*) (see the next section) for enums. The chosen size is the default enum size for the target platform's C application binary interface (ABI). Note that enum representation in C is implementation defined, so this is really a \"best guess\". In particular, this may be incorrect when the C code of interest is compiled with certain flags. Field-less enums with repr(C) or repr(u*) still may not be set to an integer value without a corresponding variant, even though this is permitted behavior in C or C++.

The control over the current thread is switched from Rust to C to Rust for the execution of the callback, but in the end the callback is executed on the same thread that called the function which triggered the callback. Things get more complicated when the external library spawns its own threads and invokes callbacks from there. In these cases access to Rust data structures inside the callbacks is especially unsafe and proper synchronization mechanisms must be used. Besides classical synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, one possibility in Rust is to use channels (in std::sync::mpsc ) to forward data from the C thread that invoked the callback into a Rust thread. If an asynchronous callback targets a special object in the Rust address space it is also absolutely necessary that no more callbacks are performed by the C library after the respective Rust object gets destroyed.

Being ready for unwinding is often referred to as exception safety in the broader programming world. In Rust, there are two levels of exception safety that one may concern themselves with: In unsafe code, we must be exception safe to the point of not violating memory safety. We'll call this minimal exception safety. In safe code, it is good to be exception safe to the point of your program doing the right thing. We'll call this maximal exception safety. As is the case in many places in Rust, Unsafe code must be ready to deal with bad Safe code when it comes to unwinding. Code that transiently creates unsound states must be careful that a panic does not cause that state to be used. Generally this means ensuring that only non-panicking code is run while these states exist, or making a guard that cleans up the state in the case of a panic. This does not necessarily mean that the state a panic witnesses is a fully coherent state. We need only guarantee that it's a safe state. Most Unsafe code is leaf-like, and therefore fairly easy to make exception-safe. It controls all the code that runs, and most of that code can't panic.

Already we can see why this signature might be trouble. That basically implies that we're going to find a str somewhere in the scope the reference to the u32 originated in, or somewhere even earlier . That's a bit of a tall order. We then proceed to compute the string s , and return a reference to it. Since the contract of our function says the reference must outlive 'a , that's the lifetime we infer for the reference. Unfortunately, s was defined in the scope 'b , so the only way this is sound is if 'b contains 'a -- which is clearly false since 'a must contain the function call itself. We have therefore created a reference whose lifetime outlives its referent, which is literally the first thing we said that references can't do. The compiler rightfully blows up in our face. To make this more clear, we can expand the example: fn as_str<'a>(data: &'a u32) -> &'a str { 'b: { let s = format!(\"{}\", data); return &'a s }\n} fn main() { 'c: { let x: u32 = 0; 'd: { // An anonymous scope is introduced because the borrow does not // need to last for the whole scope x is valid for.

Of course, the right way to write this function is as follows: fn to_string(data: &u32) -> String { format!(\"{}\", data)\n} We must produce an owned value inside the function to return it! The only way we could have returned an &'a str would have been if it was in a field of the &'a u32 , which is obviously not the case.

This would create an aliased mutable reference, which would violate the second rule of references. However this is not at all how Rust reasons that this program is bad.

This is because it's generally not really necessary to talk about lifetimes in a local context; Rust has all the information and can work out everything as optimally as possible.

Originally, our examples made use of aggressive sugar -- high fructose corn syrup even -- around scopes and lifetimes, because writing everything out explicitly is extremely noisy . All Rust code relies on aggressive inference and elision of \"obvious\" things. One particularly interesting piece of sugar is that each let statement implicitly introduces a scope. For the most part, this doesn't really matter. However it does matter for variables that refer to each other. As a simple example, let's completely desugar this simple piece of Rust code: let x = 0;\nlet y = &x;\nlet z = &y; The borrow checker always tries to minimize the extent of a lifetime, so it will likely desugar to the following: // NOTE: `'a: {` and `&'b x` is not valid syntax!\n'a: { let x: i32 = 0; 'b: { // lifetime used is 'b because that's good enough. let y: &'b i32 = &'b x; 'c: { // ditto on 'c let z: &'c &'b i32 = &'c y; } }\n} Wow.

It's also mechanically trivial to downgrade atomic operations to have a weaker consistency later on. Just change SeqCst to Relaxed and you're done! Of course, proving that this transformation is correct is a whole other matter."},"ffi.html#destructors":{"title":"Destructors","id":"ffi.html#destructors","breadcrumbs":"Destructors","body":"Foreign libraries often hand off ownership of resources to the calling code. When this occurs, we must use Rust's destructors to provide safety and guarantee the release of these resources (especially in the case of panic).
